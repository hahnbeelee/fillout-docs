## Overview

By default, Fillout uses cookies to keep respondents logged in and save their form progress if they exit the form. We recommend enabling this setting to meet minimum legal requirements.

## How to enable cookie consent

Open your form settings by clicking <Icon icon="gear-complex" /> on the upper right area.

<img
  src="/images/formsettings.png"
  alt="form settings.png"
  title="form settings.png"
  style={{ width:"31%" }}
/>

Navigate to `Form behavior` on the left and toggle the `Cookie consent` switch.
