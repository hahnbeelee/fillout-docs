## How to automate approvals

In the [**Workflows page**](https://www.fillout.com/help/workflows#how-to-create-a-workflow), select your preferred **Approval** template.

### Approve or reject submissions

By default, the form owner is the **Approver**. You can `Edit` this to choose another member of the workspace or add more approvers.

You can also opt to **Request approval by** Slack.

  style={{ width:"69%" }}
/>

If necessary, request for **Approver input** like reason and comments, and edit the default **Notification email**.

A different email will be sent depending on the option the approver will choose. When you have set your workflow, `Test` this before clicking `Publish`.

You can opt to `Edit` the contents of each email and [format its style](/custom-emails).

### Assign task for submissions

Delegate a task to your team after receiving submissions. The default workflow template, sends a summary of form responses in a Slack channel to notify members.

/>

Besides notifying, you can enhance this workflow. For example, add a step for reviewing submissions. Customize it by clicking `Edit` in **Approval** and adding **Options**.

You can opt to edit the `Custom message` in Slack and reference form fields. More info [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/slack#send-a-custom-message-to-slack).

## Manage approvals in one dashboard

When you receive an approval request, it will redirect to the `Results page` of your form where you can take the necessary `Action needed`.

You can view comments by clicking the `messaging icon` beside **Answers**.
