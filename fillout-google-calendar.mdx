## Overview

When you [connect your Google or Outlook calendar to Fillout](/fillout-scheduling-intro), your default calendar will track conflicts and block existing events to prevent double-booking. New meetings will also be added to your default calendar automatically. You can have Fillout also watch your other Google Calendars for events to ensure your availability.

## How to set up

On your dashboard, open `Scheduling` <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> settings from the left-hand panel.

Go to `Connected calendars` to enable any alternate calendars you want Fillout to watch for conflicting events.

You can also change the default calendar where new events are added by clicking the **Add to calendar** dropdown.
