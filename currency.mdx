## How to add a currency field

First, drag the `Currency` field type onto your form.

USD is the default **Currency code**. To change this, click its <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to open the right hand-panel and indicate your preferred currency. [Here is a list](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/glossary/currency-codes) of all the possible options.

## Collect a dynamic type of currency

If you'd like to let your respondents choose the currency or if it should be specified by an [external source](/integrations) (e.g. Airtable or Notion), click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to reference a field from that source.

  style={{ width:"79%" }}
/>

For example, we reference the form's currency dropdown above to let it determine the selected currency type.

## Convert currencies

Enable the `Convert currency` toggle in the right-hand panel to automatically convert the currency the respondent enters. You can specify a fixed currency to convert it to or provide it dynamically using the <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" />.

  style={{ width:"83%" }}
/>

You can also reference the converted amount anywhere in your form by typing **@** and selecting your currency question followed by **Converted value**.
