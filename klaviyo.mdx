## What is Klaviyo?

[Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) is an e-commerce marketing platform that helps businesses manage and optimize their email and SMS marketing efforts to drive sales and customer engagement.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Klaviyo">

      />
    </Frame>
    Then, select a **List** in Klaviyo you’d like to connect your form to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    [Match the fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your Klaviyo audience. For example, link the email address to its respective field.

    You can use other **Fields**, such as name, number, address, and more in your form to update your contacts' details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`.

    That's it! Answers to mapped fields from new submissions will now appear in your Klaviyo audience list. 

    <Check>
      If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add custom properties

You can add extra metadata using other fields in your form using the same steps above. For example, we'll match "Special diet" to "Do you or any of your guests have dietary preferences?"
