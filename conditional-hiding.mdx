## What is conditional logic?

**Conditional logic** is a dynamic feature that adjusts form content based on responses, creating a personalized experience and improving data accuracy.

## Hide based on a condition

Click the field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> and open the **Logic** section on the right-hand panel to `Set conditional logic`.

Then, `+ Add condition`. You can make a condition based on:

- Previous form inputs
- URL parameters (e.g., source = Facebook or Google)
- Data from an integration
- Date information (e.g., 5 days from today)

For example, we’ll only ask users to specify if they "need any special accommodations".

## Hide always

Toggle the `Hide always` switch to always hide a question or field. This is useful for [pre-filling questions](/prefill-fields) that you don’t want your users to change (e.g., a referral code that tracks where a user came from).
