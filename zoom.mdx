## What is Zoom?

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) provides remote conferencing services, offering video conferencing, online meetings, chat, and mobile collaboration.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a scheduling form">
    On your Fillout dashboard, click `+ Create` and choose [Scheduling](https://www.fillout.com/help/fillout-scheduling-intro) followed by your preferred **meeting type**.

    Name your meeting, pick a duration and click `Create`.

    <Note>
      If you haven’t yet connected to Outlook or Google Calendar, you’ll be prompted to sign in with either first.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your Scheduling form to Zoom">
    Once in the editor, on the left-hand panel, `+ Add meeting location` and select `Zoom`. Then, `Connect to Zoom`.

    />

    You’ll be prompted to grant access to create meetings automatically in your Zoom account (and also the option to edit those meetings if your clients choose to reschedule or cancel).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Before finishing, you’ll have a default **Availability** schedule created in Fillout which you can [edit in the settings](https://www.fillout.com/help/fillout-scheduling-availability), along with [meeting buffer times](https://www.fillout.com/help/limit-bookings), and more, in the left-hand panel.

    Click `Publish` in the top-right corner to get a shareable public link to your scheduling form, which is now automatically synced to your connectedd (Google or Outlook) calendar and Zoom account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schedule calls based on conditions

You can choose to only schedule calls with certain users, by sending them to different pages of your form depending on their answers, even automatically based on data like [company size and industry](/page-logic).

## Disconnect Zoom from Scheduling Forms

If you’d like to stop scheduling Zoom calls, you can click **x** next to Zoom meeting location to remove it from your form. Remember to click `Publish` in the top-right corner again to make that change go live.
