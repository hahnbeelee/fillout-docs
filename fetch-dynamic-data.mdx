## Get the data you need

To display dynamic data, first pull the data from Airtable, Notion, or another source into your form. There are several options for doing this, depending on your use case:

- [Login page](/login-page) - gives you access to the full user record of whoever logs in
- [URL parameters](/url-parameters) - to pass any arbitrary information to your form (e.g., from Stacker, [Softr](/embed-fillout-softr), or other portals
- **Record picker** field type - to access any field in the record that is chosen. (You can also [pre-fill record pickers](https://www.fillout.com/help/record-pickers#how-to-pre-fill-a-record-picker).)
- [Pre-fetch records](/pre-fetch-data) - to fetch information from Airtable or Notion before your form loads

## Reference the data in your form

In Fillout, you can **display data almost anywhere**: in question labels, alerts, logic for hiding or validating questions, and more. In this example, we'll use a Text field type, which lets us display uneditable, formatted text.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Heading field">
    First, drag and drop the Heading field from the left-hand panel to your form. In this example, we have a record picker (Choose a manufacturer) that we want to display more information from.

      alt="Screenshot of the Fillout form creation page"
      style={{ width:"81%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference a field">
    Type **@** in the heading field to open a menu for picking references to previous form inputs. In the reference picker, click field you want to display.

      alt="Screenshot of the Fillout form creation page"
      style={{ width:"81%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it! The blue bubbles in the center indicate the fields we are referencing. This text will now automatically change whenever you pick a new value in the record picker.

    Test your form in `Preview` mode to see it in action. `Publish` it once all is set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Other places to reference data

You can also reference the result of the integration step in [show/hide](/conditional-hiding) and [validation](/input-validation) conditions to customize your form and prevent input errors. Click a field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to open the right-hand panel.

For example, let's show a warning when a field is missing in a record.

Reference data in the **Default value** to pre-fill fields. More info [here](/prefill-fields).
