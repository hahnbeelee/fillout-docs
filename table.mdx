  <Step title="Choose your field types">
    Choose from 5 different field types: short answer, email input, date picker, dropdown, and number. The email input field will only accept valid email addresses.

    Reorder the columns by dragging them in the right-hand panel.

## Table vs choice matrix

With a **table**, you can add different types of question fields, such as text, numbers, or dropdowns. In contrast, a [**choice matrix**](/matrix) is limited to using only radio buttons for tasks like rating, comparing, or selecting options within a grid.
