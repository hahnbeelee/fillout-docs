You’ll get a unique referral link to share. When new users sign up for a paid Fillout plan through it, you’ll receive commissions.

- **30% recurring commission** for up to one year
- **50% extra signup Zite credits** given to your refferals
- Referrals must be **new users**

## FAQs

**Q: How do I get paid?**

Commissions are paid monthly via your preferred payment ACH method set in the affiliate dashboard.

**Q: Can I customize my link?**

Yes, you can customize the handle/slug in your dashboard.

**Q: What if someone clicks multiple affiliate links?**

The first affiliate link clicked gets credit for the conversion.

**Q: What if I forgot to use my affiliate link for a client signup?**

Currently we can only apply affiliate commissions retroactively for verified solution partners. Apply to become a solution partner [here](https://main.fillout.com/solution-partner-application).

**Q: Can I see which accounts I referred from my affiliate link?**

For privacy reasons, the affiliate dashboard anonymizes the email addresses of the users you refer. You'll see the list of referrals with randomly generated names (e.g. "Influential Rose Frog").
