## Overview

Duplicating an entire form can be useful if you want to keep all of your fields and just make a few adjustments, or make a new version of your form without updating the old one.

## How to duplicate a form

From your dashboard, hover over the form you want to duplicate and click <Icon icon="ellipsis" /> to `Duplicate`.

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-10-16at6.52.25PM.png"
  alt="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 6.52.25 PM.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 6.52.25 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"58%" }}
/>

That’s it! You will now have two identical forms, with different unique links.
