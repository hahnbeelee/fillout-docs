Choose a field in the dropdown. In this example, we will prevent submissions from getting saved to Airtable if they match another entry in the Product Name field.

That’s it\! Your form will no longer create duplicate entries.

<Note>
  **Note:** This feature currently works with email and single line fields. Support for other Airtable fields is on our roadmap.
