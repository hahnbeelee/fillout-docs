    Next, pick the field to base duplication checks on. In this example, we will prevent submissions from getting saved to Airtable if they match another entry in the Product Name field.

    <Warning>
      This feature currently works with email and single line fields. Support for other Airtable fields is on our roadmap.

  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! Your form will no longer create duplicate entries. Make sure to `Publish` your form to make the changes reflect.
