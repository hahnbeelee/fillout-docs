## What is round robin scheduling

Round robin scheduling allocates appointments among hosts based on availability and priorities, ensuring each host gets equal opportunities and preventing any single host from being overloaded.

## Manage Priority and Availability

### Priority Settings

On the left-hand panel, you can assign priority levels to participants to control the distribution of appointments. Higher priority members are more likely to receive bookings if multiple participants are available at the same time.

### Automatic Assignment

Fillout’s round robin algorithm assigns appointments based on the last scheduled participant to ensure even distribution, provided all conditions of priority and availability are met.

### Adjusting Locations and Meeting Details

Define one **Meeting location** or set different locations for each participant. Choose between Google Meet, Teams, Zoom, and more.
