## Overview

Delaying [actions](/workflows) gives you control over when tasks are triggered. You can set this delay to last for just a few minutes or extend it to hours or days, depending on your needs. This is especially useful for workflows that require follow-ups, reminders, or timed sequences.

## How to delay an action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a workflow">
    Click `Integrate` on the top menu of your form, followed by `Workflows`. Then, start with a `+ Blank workflow`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose delay as a first action">
    Select a **trigger**. Then, choose `Delay` and set how soon you want a task to be done. The default is 30 minutes but you can delay for days.

  <Step title="Add another action">
    Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" /> under Delay to add another **action**. For this example, let’s choose `Send email`. We'll email them a list of requirements to submit. Remember to `Test` your workflow.

      style={{ width:"58%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! `Publish` and share your form. Now, every form submission will send the custom email to respondents 3 days after completing the form.
