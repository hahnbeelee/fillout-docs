Head to the **Enrich** section where you can:

- **Disallow free email accounts** - to block free email accounts (e.g., @yahoo.com, @gmail.com, and @hotmail.com) and require business or org emails only
- **Validate email addresses** - to only allow valid emails to be submitted. Fillout calls a third party service to check if the email is valid. This helps prevent typos, like if someone types [jeff@amazon.co](mailto:jeff@amazon.co) instead of [jeff@amazon.com](mailto:jeff@amazon.com)
- **Enrich with Apollo** - route leads to different pages based on company details. More info [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/lead-enrichment).
- **Send verification code** - to send OTPs to emails or phone numbers. Check out the guide [here](/email-sms-otp).

Validation rules are enforced when respondent tries to proceed to the next page.
