## What is Discord?

[Discord](https://discord.com/) is a communication platform designed for creating communities, where users can chat via text, voice, and video, often organized around specific topics or interests.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Fillout form to Discord">
    Open your form or create a new one in Fillout. Click `Integrate` from the top menu and look for `Discord`.

    Sign in with your Discord account to `Authorize` access. Then, choose a server from the dropdown menu to `Continue`.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a channel">
    Choose a channel to send messages to and your preferred message formatting. `Finish setup` to test your form and `Publish` it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it! Now every time your form is submitted, you’ll get a notification on your chosen Discord channel. `Publish` your form and share or embed it anywhere.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Message formatting

### **Send all fields (recommended)**

By default, form submissions are summarized and sent to your channel.

### **Custom message**

You can tailor the default message to display only selected fields. Simply click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> on the right side or type **@** to choose specific fields or [other values](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#other-mappings).
