## What is form abandonment

**Form abandonment** occurs when respondents start filling out a form but exit before reaching the last page. When respondents abandon forms, it indicates a lost opportunity for capturing valuable leads or completing transactions. Addressing your [page drop-off rate](https://www.fillout.com/help/analytics#check-page-drop-off-rates) is crucial for improving overall conversion rates, enhancing customer satisfaction, and maximizing business outcomes.
