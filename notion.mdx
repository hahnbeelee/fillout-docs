## What is Notion?

[**Notion**](https://www.notion.so/) is one of the most popular all-in-one productivity and collaboration tools. It’s a flexible workspace for teams and individuals to create and organize notes, documents, databases, and task lists.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your database in Notion">
    <Note>
      If you already have your database created in Notion, you can skip this step.
    </Note>
    On your [Notion page](https://www.notion.com/help/create-your-first-page), type `/database`. Name your database and add a column for each question. Set the property type and, if using Select or Multi-select, enter the answer options.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your Fillout form to Notion">
    On your [Fillout](https://build.fillout.com/home) dashboard, [create a form](https://www.fillout.com/help/make-a-form). Choose to `Connect` to Notion.

    Choose your theme (don’t worry, you can always change this later). Then, enter your **Account name** and `Connect to Notion`.

    `Select pages` you’d like to allow Fillout access to. You can add and remove pages to this integration anytime in your Fillout dashboard.

    />

    Then, choose the the **Database** you’ll be using with your form.

    <Warning>
      Don’t see your database in the dropdown list? Check you have connected to the correct workspace and granted access to the page where your database is.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your questions">
    Your `Notion Columns` now appear on the left-hand panel of your Fillout form editor. Simply drag and drop to start building your form.

    <Tip>
      To update your Fillout form after editing your Notion database, click <Icon icon="arrows-rotate" size={12} /> on the left-hand panel.
    </Tip>
    To connect a new question to your Notion database, or check an existing connection, click a field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> and go to **Connected** in the right-hand panel.

    />

    Alternatively, you can [manually map fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#map-fillout-fields-to-integrations) in the `Integrate` page.

    You can also add content to the body of a Notion page. See this [help article](/notion-add-page-content).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish & Share">
    Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go ! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Notion database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).

Fillout has many powerful features like [**branching**](/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.
