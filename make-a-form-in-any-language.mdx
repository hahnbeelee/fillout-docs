## How to change the language of your form

Go to your form's **Settings** from the top right menu.

</Frame>

Then, click `Language` in the left side to select your preferred **Default language**. That's it\! `Publish` your form and share the link.

Changing the form’s language will affect system messages throughout the form. For example, the text inside the **File uploader** field type will be changed from “Drag & drop a file or upload” to “Arrastra y suelta un archivo o navega”.

<Note>
  **Note:** This feature only translates text that you can't manually edit. Questions, button labels, text, and choice labels will remain the same. However, you are free to edit them.

## Translate your form

Unlike changing your form’s [**Default language**](https://www.notion.so/Create-multilingual-forms-d67d7d8e65f54e76b9c50dd48816f742?pvs=21), which switches it to a single language, translating your form lets respondents access it in multiple languages. Go to your form’s `Language` **Settings**.

Then, toggle `Enable translations` and click `+ Add language` to insert your preferred languages.

## Disable Google Translate

Many Chrome respondents have Google Translate on, which auto-translates websites. If you’ve already set your form to your preferred language, you can stop the respondent’s browser from auto-translating the form.

In your form’s `Language` **Settings**, toggle `Disable auto-translate`.
