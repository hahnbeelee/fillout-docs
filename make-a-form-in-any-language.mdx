## How to change the language of your form

Go to your form's **Settings** from the top menu, and click `Language` in the left side. Then, select your preferred **Default language**. That's it\! `Publish` your form and share the link.

Changing the form’s language will affect system messages throughout the form. For example, the text inside the **File uploader** field type will be changed from “Drag & drop a file or upload” to “Arrastra y suelta un archivo o navega”.
