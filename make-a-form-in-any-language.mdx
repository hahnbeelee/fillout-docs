## How to change form language

Open your form settings by clicking <Icon icon="gear-complex" /> on the upper right area.

Then, click `Language` in the left-hand panel to select your preferred **Default language**. That's it! `Publish` your form and share the link.

Changing the form’s language will affect system messages throughout the form. For example, the text inside this file uploader field type will automatically be translated into Korean.

  style={{ width:"75%" }}
/>

<Warning>
  This feature only translates text that you can't manually edit. Questions, button labels, text, and choice labels will remain the same. However, you are free to edit them.
</Warning>

## Translate your form

Unlike changing your form’s [**Default language**](https://www.notion.so/Create-multilingual-forms-d67d7d8e65f54e76b9c50dd48816f742?pvs=21), which switches it to a single language, translating your form lets respondents access it in multiple languages. Go to your form’s `Language` settings.

![Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 6.26.26 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-10-16at6.26.26PM.png)

Then `Enable translations` and `+ Add` your preferred languages.

## Disable Google Translate

Many Chrome respondents have Google Translate on, which auto-translates websites. If you’ve already set your form to your preferred language, you can stop the respondent’s browser from auto-translating the form.

![Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 6.29.03 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-10-16at6.29.03PM.png)

In your form’s `Language` settings, `Disable auto-translate`.
