## How it works

Each Fillout Scheduling meeting invitation in Google or Outlook Calendar will include the names of the meeting participants, along with a link to join a Zoom or Google Meet call if selected.

The event details will also include a Fillout link to `Cancel` or `Reschedule` the meeting if needed.
