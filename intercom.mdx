## What is Intercom?

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is a customer communication platform that integrates various messaging services to facilitate business-to-customer interactions. It allows companies to manage support, sales, and marketing communications through live chat, bots, and personalized messaging.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Intercom">
    Open the form you want to `Integrate` with Intercom.

    <img src="/images/Screenshot2025-11-18at5.14.19PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-18 at 5.14.19 PM.png" /> Then, enter an **account name** to connect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    [Match the fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in Intercom for the new message. Make sure to include the contact's **email** and the **message** content.

    You can also choose to `Create new leads` or `users` if they don’t exist with the email in question, and associate answers in the form to the user.

    <Note>
      New conversations (or form submissions) are created as chats, not emails.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`.

    New form submissions will now create new messages, and optionally new leads/users directly in your Intercom!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
