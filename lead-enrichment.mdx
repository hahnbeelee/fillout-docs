## Enriching leads and conditional routing

If you enable `Enrich with Apollo` in the right-hand panel, you’ll receive access to the following properties after a respondent fills out their email:

- **Employee count** - total number of employees that work at the company
- **Employment name** - name of the company the person works for
- **Employment domain** - domain of the company the person works for
- **Employment role** - a person’s standardized role at the company they work for based on their title. 
- **Company traffic rank** - a company’s standing in a global rank of company website traffic as calculated by Apollo.
- **Company employee range** - number of employees that work at the company by range. Useful for segmenting companies by size.
- **Company estimated annual revenue** - estimate of the company’s annual revenue by range.

Common use cases include:

- Routing leads with over x employees to a [scheduling page](/scheduling-page) with your enterprise team
- Creating multiple scheduling pages to route leads based on region, industry or company size

That's it! Now, when respondents enter their email in your form, you'll see their company details automatically collected in the [Results page](https://www.fillout.com/help/view-responses).

With [page logic](/page-logic), you can conditionally route leads based on the data obtained from the email field.

Lastly, you can send enriched data to [any integration]() by setting up [additional mappings](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings) on the `Integrations` tab.
