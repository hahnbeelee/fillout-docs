## What is Attio?

[**Attio**](https://attio.com/?ref=fillout) is a CRM platform that adapts to different business needs, effectively managing sales, customer relationships, and data. It stands out for its ease of use, strong data integration, and focus on security.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Attio">
    Open the Fillout form you want to connect with Attio, then go to `Integrate` in the top menu. Click `Attio` to link your form to an object.

    Enter a `Name` for your Attio connection, then `Connect to Attio`. You will be prompted to grant access to a workspace of your choice.

    Next, select an **Object** you’d like to sync form responses to.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Map form fields">
    Attio attributes will automatically show up as form fields on the left-hand panel. Simply drag them onto your form.

    Alternatively, you can [manually map](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) them in the `Integrate` page. Select the Attio attributes in the left and map it to the relevant Fillout field in the right.

    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    `Publish` your form. Now, answers to matched fields will appear in the attributes of your record on Attio.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating existing records

If you’d like to update existing records that already exist, just toggle `Update if record already exists?` under **Mappings**. Then, choose which attribute you’d like to use to determine the record to update.
