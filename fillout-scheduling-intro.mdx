    On the left-hand panel, you can also customize the ff:

    - **Notifications** - send a customizable automated email reminder
    - **Advanced** - customize Google Calendar event details, time increments, and share link
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the style">
    Go to [Theme](/customize-fillout-scheduling) to edit your form's design. You even [change your avatar](https://www.fillout.com/help/customize-fillout-scheduling#change-your-avatar) to your logo to match your brand and edit the button label.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! `Publish` your form and share the link or embed it anywhere.

## Add a calendar to a standard Fillout form

Fillout's core form editor also includes an option to add a [Scheduling page](/scheduling-page) to any form. Open an existing form, and click `+ Add Page` at the bottom followed by `Scheduling`.

/>

You'll get the same functionalities as in standalone Fillout Scheduling forms, inside your multi-page form with your other existing Fillout form questions.

Or, if you already use Calendly or Cal.com, you can select them and [add your existing scheduling calendar to Fillout](/scheduling-page).

## How Fillout Scheduling Works

[Fillout Scheduling](https://www.fillout.com/scheduling) forms let people book available slots on your calendar while ensuring the time works for you. The forms show a calendar, meeting details, and organizer info by default.

  Respondents can select their timezone to view slots in local time.

Fillout will prompt for their name and email. After clicking `Schedule event`, respondents will receive an email containing the details and a reschedule link. Events are automatically added to Google and Outlook calendars.
