## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your form to update mode">
    Open your [Salesforce-connected form](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce) and navigate to the `Integrate` tab and select `Salesforce`.

    Then, click `Update record`.

    <Info>
      The Salesforce integration is available on the **Enterprise Tier 1 and 2** plans. Learn more [here](https://www.fillout.com/enterprise).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the provided formula">
    You'll now get a formula that defines a unique link for every record in your object. Add this new formula to your Salesforce object.

    Go to your Salesforce dashboard and click the `settings icon` on the upper right side followed by `Open Advanced Setup`.

      alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form"
      style={{ width:"52%" }}
    />

    Using **Quick Find** on the left-panel, search for `Object Manager`. Click your `object`. In our example, we used Contact.

      style={{ width:"59%" }}
    />

    Go to `Fields & Relationships` and create a `New` field.

    Select **Formula** from the list. Then, paste provied formula on Fillout into Salesforce.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Complete your setup by clicking `Finish setup`. You can test your form in `Preview` mode.

    Your form will **automatically pre-fill** the data for the record it is updating.

    Then, `Publish` your form to reflect the changes. Click one of your unique links from Salesforce to update a record after publishing!

    <Note>
      If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new record instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced next steps (optional)

Enhance your update forms by integrating them with platforms like Salesforce App Builder or Lightning Experience. Instead of the formula in Step 3, you might consider using a `Button` field.

This button can then be embedded within Salesforce interfaces for users to easily manage records.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
