## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your form to update mode">
    Open your [Salesforce-connected form](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce) and navigate to the `Integrate` tab and select `Salesforce`.

    Then, click `Update record`.

    You'll now get a formula in Fillout that defines a **unique link** for every page in your table.

    <Info>
      The Salesforce integration is available on the **Team** and **Enterprise** plans. Learn more about the [Team plan](/team-plan).
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste the provided formula">
    Add this new formula to your Salesforce object.

    />

    Go to your Salesforce dashboard and click the `settings icon` on the upper right side followed by `Open Advanced Setup`.

      alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form"
      style={{ width:"52%" }}
    />

    Using **Quick Find** on the left-panel, search for `Object Manager`. Click your `object`. In our example, we used Contact.

      alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form"
      style={{ width:"59%" }}
    />

    Go to `Fields & Relationships` and create a `New` field.

    Select **Formula** from the list. Then, paste provied formula on Fillout into Salesforce.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Complete your setup by clicking `Update` and `Publish`.

    To update a Salesforce record, click `Preview` and select a **Record to update** or click one of the unique links from your Salesforce object.

    ![Screenshot 2025-11-11 at 5.21.44 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-11-11at5.21.44PM.png)

    Your form will **automatically pre-fill** the data for the record it is updating.

    <Note>
      If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new record instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced next steps (optional)

Enhance your update forms by integrating them with platforms like Salesforce App Builder or Lightning Experience. Instead of the formula in Step 3, you might consider using a `Button` field.

This button can then be embedded within Salesforce interfaces for users to easily manage records.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
