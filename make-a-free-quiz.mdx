    Put a **✓** beside the correct answer. You can choose multiple correct answers, if applicable, and even define a score value for each answer.

      alt="Set up scoring"
      style={{ width:"64%" }}
    />

    **Add weighted scores**

    Typically, you’ll want to assign a score of 1 for correct answers and 0 for incorrect answers, but you can assign custom point values to weigh certain questions more heavily than others.

    **Adding custom feedback**

    You can also display a custom message to respondents based on their answers. To do so, enable `Custom answer feedback` and toggle the `Show correct answers after each page` option in your form settings (step 1).

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the design">
    Now, the fun part! Customize the look and feel of your quiz with Fillout’s [Form designer](/themes). Simply, click `Theme`. For more options, scroll down and open the `Advanced Designer`.

      style={{ width:"76%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Publish and share">
    Once your quiz is complete, click `Publish` on the upper right corner and share the link or embed it anywhere.

    You can also enable [email notifications](/email-notifications) for whenever someone fills out your quiz. The respondent’s score will be included in the email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and analyze results">
    Fillout provides real-time reporting and analytics on your quiz [results](/results). You can view individual responses or analyze trends and patterns in the `Results` page of your quiz.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced quiz features

**Show custom ending messages or pages**

Display different ending messages depending on a respondent's score by using [hide/show logic](/conditional-hiding). To display different ending pages, set up [page logic](page-logic).

**Show a summary of answers on the ending page**

Display a list of correct answers alongside the respondent’s answers. Reference their answers by typing **@** and selecting the relevant question.

  title="Screenshot 2025-11-24 at 3.26.43 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"70%" }}
/>

You can also use [logic](https://www.fillout.com/help/conditional-hiding#hide-a-question-based-on-a-condition) to show only the answers the respondent got wrong. Drag your mouse across the relevant fields. On the right-hand pane, `Set conditional logic`.

In this example, we'll just show these info if their answer `does not equal` the correct answer.
