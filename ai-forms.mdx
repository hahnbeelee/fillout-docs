## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the AI Form Builder">
    On Fillout, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click [**AI Form Builder**](https://www.fillout.com/ai-form-builder).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose how you want to create your form">
    Start from scratch by specifying the form you need or build from an existing structure by importing questions or a file.

    **Describe form**
    Specify the form you want or choose a sample. Then, `Generate form`.

    **Import questions**
    List your questions vertically — one line equals one question or field. At the bottom, select how you want the **Questions per page** to be displayed.

    **Import form**
    You can use forms you've already created outside Fillout. Choose between these form builders or enter a form URL.

    <Check>
      **Good to know:** You can bulk import forms, including their responses.

    **From PDF**
    Even documents that aren't technically forms can be converted as long as they're saved as PDFs. Simply upload the file [here](https://www.fillout.com/pdf-to-form?source=ai_form_builder).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your AI form">
    [Style](/themes) your form, require and [reorder questions](/reorder-with-drag-and-drop), add [logic](/logic), and more. Then, click `Publish` in the upper right corner to share your form via link or embed.
