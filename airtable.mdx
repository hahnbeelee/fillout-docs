## What is Airtable?

[**Airtable**](https://airtable.com/) is a cloud-based collaborative database and project management platform that combines the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the power of a database.

## Video tutorial

Check out this tutorial on using Fillout to create or update an Airtable base.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your database in Airtable">
    <Note>
      If you already have your base created in Airtable, you can skip this step.
    </Note>
    Log in to [Airtable](https://airtable.com/), and click `Create`  on the lower left corner of your dashboard.

      style={{ width:"42%" }}
    />

    Give your base a **name**, and create the **fields** you need. You’ll need one field for every question in your form (e.g., Single line text for a short answer, Single select for radio buttons, Multi-select, etc).

    If you are using the Select and Multi-select properties, make sure to type in the options you’d like people to choose from.

    Once you’ve added a **field** (and options, when needed) for every response field in your form, 90% of your work is now done.

    Nice work! Now you’re ready to sync it easily with a new or existing Fillout form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your database to your Fillout form">
    On your [Fillout](https://build.fillout.com/home) dashboard, [create a form](https://www.fillout.com/help/make-a-form). Choose to `Connect` to Airtable.

    Select your theme (don’t worry, you can always change this later). Then, enter your **Account name** and `Connect to Airtable`.

    <Note>
      After connecting, you can switch to use [personal access tokens](https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-and-using-api-keys-and-access-tokens) via the Integrations page.
    </Note>
    After making the selections, click `+ Create form`.

    <Warning>
      Don’t see your table in the dropdown list? Check you have connected to the correct base, and try refreshing the page.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your questions">
    Fillout pulls questions and answer options from your Airtable base. Your `Airtable fields` now appear in the left sidebar. Simply drag & drop to build your form.

    To connect a new question to your Airtable database, or check an existing connection, open the right-hand panel or go to mappings. Check out [this quick guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually).

    <Tip>
      To [update your Fillout form](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#updating-fields-and-options) after editing your Airtable, click <Icon icon="arrows-rotate" size={12} /> on the left-hand panel.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish & Share">
    Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Airtable database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Fillout has many powerful features like [branching](/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
