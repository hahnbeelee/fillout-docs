## When do I need an editable form?

Making your forms editable improves the accuracy of the data you collect and reduces back-and-forth with your users. Common use cases include:

- Event RSVPs — let respondents update their answers if plans change.
- Surveys — allow edits when users have new information to share.
- Newsletter signups — let users adjust their notification preferences later.

There are different ways to enable form edits in Fillout, depending on your needs.

## Option 1: Automated edit link notification

If you want all respondents to receive an edit link by default, use this approach. First, quickly enable [respondent notifications](/respondent-emails). Make sure to toggle `Include a link to edit submission`.

Upon submissions, respondents will receive an email with a clear button to `Edit submission`.

## Option 2: Send response field type

If you want to make the respondent opt-in, use this approach instead. On your form’s [ending page](/ending-page), drag-and-drop the `Send response` field type from the left-hand panel.

Click <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to `Include edit link` in the right-hand panel.

## Option 3: Manual edit link sharing

First, head to the `Results` tab on your form and [open the submission in question](https://www.fillout.com/help/view-responses#view-individual-submissions). Click <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> followed by `Edit`. A new tab will open with the filled submission. Copy the link and share it.

## Updating integrations

With the approaches described above, your connected 3rd-party integrations will automatically be updated whenever someone submits the edit link. For example, if your form is connected to Airtable, re-submitting the form from a respondent notification link will update the record in Airtable.

You can also set up edit links for specific integrations. See these guides or follow the same instructions for other integrations, like SmartSuite or Monday.com.

  <Card title="Update existing Notion pages" icon="arrow-rotate-right" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" href="/notion-update-form">
    Edit existing Notion pages and pre-fill fields.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Closing the form

If you’ve sent out an edit link but no longer want to accept submissions, you can always [close your form](https://www.fillout.com/help/manage-form-access#close-form) to new submissions and edits.
