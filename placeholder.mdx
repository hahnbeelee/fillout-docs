## Overview

Placeholders are often used to show a sample answer or give instructions on how to respond. You can also use them to type your question directly into the field, making form shorter and neater.

## How to add placeholders to text fields

Click the text field followed by its <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to open the right-hand panel. Then, type your **Placeholder**.

## Add placeholders to choice fields

Similar to the step above, click the field followed by its <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to show the right-hand panel. Then, type your **Placeholder**.

/>

<Warning>
  Placeholders disappear once a respondent starts typing in the field or selects an option. These aren't intended to [pre-fill an answer](/answer-piping) for respondents.
</Warning>

## Reference previous answers as placeholders

You can use a respondent’s previous answer to remind them or guide a question or field. This is especially useful in forms with multiple related questions, so respondents don’t have to scroll back.

Under **Placeholder**, click the <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or type **@** to reference a field with the previous answer.

/>

In our example, we first asked how they heard about us, and then added a follow-up field to ask which specific platform.
