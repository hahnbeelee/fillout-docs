Placeholders are often used to show an example answer or give instructions on how to respond. You can also use them to type your question directly into the field, helping keep your form shorter and neater.

## How to add placeholders to text fields

Click the text field followed by its `gear icon` to open the right sidebar. Then, type your **Placeholder**.

/>

<Note>
  **Note: **Placeholders disappear once a respondent starts typing in the field or selects an option. These aren't intended to [pre-fill an answer](/answer-piping) for respondents.
</Note>

## Reference previous answers as placeholders

You can use a respondent’s previous answer to remind them or guide a question or field. This is especially useful in forms with multiple related questions, so respondents don’t have to scroll back.

Under **Placeholder**, click the `+` icon or type `@` to reference a field with the previous answer.

/>

In our example, we first asked how they heard about us, and then added a follow-up field to ask which specific platform.
