## How to add a heading

Click `Heading` in the left-hand panel or simply drag and drop it onto your form. Then, type the text you want to display.

By default, your header will be colored according to your form’s theme. To change this, highlight the `header text`. You can also edit its formatting here and even make it a [hyperlink](https://www.fillout.com/help/add-links-to-form).
