## What is ActiveCampaign?

[**ActiveCampaign**](https://www.fillout.com/integrations/activecampaign) is a platform for email marketing and lead nurturing, enabling businesses to automate personalized communications and targeted campaigns for effective customer engagement and conversion optimization.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to ActiveCampaign">
    Open the form you want to `Integrate` with ActiveCampaign.

    <Warning>
      When creating your form, make sure to set the email, name, and other fields you would like to link to your ActiveCampaign list to **required**.
    </Warning>
    Enter your **API URL** and **API Key** from ActiveCampaign into Fillout. Go to the link in the banner to learn how to find these. Then, select a **List** in ActiveCampaign you’d like to connect to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    [Match the fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your ActiveCampaign list. For example, link the email address to its respective field.

    You can use other **Fields**, such as name, number, and more in your form to update your contacts' details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`.

    That's it! Answers to mapped fields from new submissions will now appear in your ActiveCampaign list.

    <Check>
      If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to add tags

You can add ActiveCampaign tags to new contacts automatically to help group your newsletter audiences. `+ Add tag` and choose from the dropdown.

To add a tag to specific contacts, toggle the `Add contionally?` switch. `Set conditional logic` and choose when to apply it. For example, we'll add the "New" tag when a customer hasn't been part of our waitlist before.

Remember to click `Publish` after making any changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. More info [here](/conditional-integration).
