## Overview

To keep your form results organized and easier to analyze, it's important to delete test submissions and other unnecessary responses.

## How to remove a submission

Go to the `Results` page of your form from the top menu. Simply **right click** on a cell, then `Delete row`

To delete multiple submissions, hover over the leftmost column and put a <Icon icon="square-check" iconType="solid" /> next to the submissions, then `Delete row/s`.

<Warning>
  Deleting a submission is permanent and cannot be undone, so be sure to double-check before deleting. Additionally, deleting a submission may affect any visualizations or statistics generated from the form results.

## Deleted file uploads

Deleting a submission also deletes its file uploads from our system.

Files already uploaded to tools like Airtable will stay there. For integrations where we only send a file **link** (not the file itself), deleting the submission (containing that file) will break that link. For example, HubSpot only receives a link, so access will be lost once the file is deleted.
