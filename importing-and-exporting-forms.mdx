### Update connections (if necessary)

If you're importing a form that has a connection to Airtable, Notion or another integration, find them in the `Integrate` tab on top. For each integration, `+ Connect new account`. 

You won't need to set up the field mappings again, just select a new connection.

Then, select a **Base** and **Table**. [Refresh connection](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#updating-fields-and-options) if some fields are missing or if the table isn't showing up
