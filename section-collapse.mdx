## How to group questions

Simply drag the `Section collapse` field onto your form.

To end a section and start a new one on the same page, add another `Section collapse` field.

You can also enable `Is collapsable` to allow the user to open or close a particular section. Click the field followed by its <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to toggle the switch on the right-hand panel.

  style={{ width:"78%" }}
/>

This is how it would look like from your respondents' point of view.

## Conditionally hide many questions at once

If you set [conditional hiding](/conditional-hiding) logic on a section, all the questions in that section will be shown/hidden based on that logic. This can be done on the right-hand panel.
