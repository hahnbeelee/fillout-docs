## What is Zendesk?

[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a customer service software company that provides a cloud-based customer support platform. This platform enables businesses to manage customer interactions across phone, chat, email, social media, and any other channel you can imagine, all in one place.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Zendesk">
    Open the form you want to `Integrate` with `Zendesk`.

    Then, enter your **Zendesk** subdomain. More details on how to find your subdomain [here](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409381383578-Where-can-I-find-my-Zendesk-subdomain-).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    [Match the fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in Zendesk for the new message. Make sure to include the contact's **email**, **name**, **subject**, and the **ticket description**.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`.

    New form submissions will now create tickets directly in your Zendesk!
