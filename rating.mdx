## How to add the rating field

Look for the **Rating & Ranking** section on the left hand-panel. Choose between three rating field types, `Star rating`, `Slider`, and `Opinion Scale`.

Click on the question or statement followed by its <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to customize it in the right-hand panel.

If you decide to use a different type of rating field, you can quickly change it by clicking on <Icon icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" iconType="solid" /> under <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" />.

## Rating vs. ranking

Although similar, rating and ranking accomplish different goals. **Rating** questions are used to compare different options using a numeric scale. For example, asking product users how effective a vitamin C serum is in fading dark spots. Conversely, [ranking](/ranking) questions are used to determine how strongly or weakly a respondent feels with items on a list. For example, asking respondents to rank their most and least favorite movie genre.
