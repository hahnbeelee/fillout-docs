## What is Google Ads

[**Google Ads**](https://ads.google.com/?ref=filloutforms-helparticle) is a platform that enables businesses to display ads on Google's search results and other affiliated websites. It offers a powerful tool for businesses to reach their target audience, increase visibility, and drive traffic to their websites.

## Why upload form conversion data to Google Ads?

Uploading form submission conversion data to Google Ads lets you measure the effectiveness of your ad campaigns in driving desired user actions, such as lead generation for specific ad clicks. Furthermore, with enhanced conversions, you can improve **conversion measurement accuracy**, providing more data for optimizing your ad strategies automatically.

<Warning>
  The Google Ads integration is part of the conversion kit paid add-on. Learn more and get started [here](https://www.fillout.com/conversion-kit).
