## Building with Zite

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can I build?">
    Zite is most commonly used to build internal tools, dashboards, portals, and business web applications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tips for effective prompts">
    - Be specific about what you want Zite to change
    - Build in small steps
    - Use clear instructions (e.g., "Change the submission button color to blue")
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect my own AI model API key?">
    This is not currently supported. All AI usage is provided through Zite and included in your plan limits.

    However, you can connect your own OpenAI API key to create apps that use AI with the Zite OpenAI integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle errors?">
    - Use the built-in "fix it for me" option if an error occurs
    - Rephrase your request with more detail
    - Restore to a previous working version if needed
    - Use selective edits for small, targeted fixes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect a database?">
    Yes. Zite has a built-in database, or you can connect to external databases like Airtable or Google Sheets.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I rename, duplicate, or delete a Zite?">
    Yes—these options are available from the home dashboard [here](https://build.fillout.com). Duplicating creates a standalone copy you can modify.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I collaborate with my team?">
    Yes. Invite teammates to your workspace to build together. Learn more about [inviting collaborators](/invite-collaborators) and [managing workspaces](/workspaces).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I publish my app?">
    Click Publish on the top right corner to push your project live. You can add a custom domain or use the default Zite link.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many apps can I build?">
    There is no limit to the number of apps you can build on any plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many users can my apps have?">
    There is no limit to the number of users or visitors your apps can have.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export my code?">
    You can export apps between Zite accounts, but the code currently will not run out-of-the-box in an external environment. Zite hosts your applications on infrastructure powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can host an unlimited number of Zites on any plan (including the free tier). In the future, we may offer an export option to host on other platforms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use my own custom domain?">
    Yes. You can connect your own domain to any published Zite project. You can connect an unlimited number of domains if you're on the Zite Business plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I remove Zite branding?">
    Yes. Zite branding is removed on any paid plan.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Your Account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is Zite pricing separate from my Fillout plan, and how does it work?">
    Yes. Zite pricing helps cover the cost of AI usage for building Zite apps. 
    The free plan is available to all Fillout users, and you can purchase a Zite plan to unlock more credits and features.
    <br /><br />
    View pricing details and manage your subscription [here](https://build.fillout.com/home/settings/billing).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a credit?">
    Credits are consumed when you send AI messages to build and modify your Zite apps.
    <br /><br />
    Credit usage varies based on the complexity of your request—simpler changes use fewer credits while more complex features use more.
    <br /><br />
    Under the hood, credits correspond to the AI LLM usage and take into account:
    - The complexity of the task
    - The number of files that are read
    - The number of changes that are written
    <br /><br />
    Selective edits (like changing text or colors directly) don't use any credits.
    <br /><br />
    There is no credit charge for using your apps, only for building them.
    <br /><br />
    Customers can check their current credit usage here: [Billing & Usage](https://build.fillout.com/home/settings/billing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my credits when I upgrade?">
    When you upgrade to a new plan, your total credit limit is set to the new plan's limits.
    <br /><br />
    For example, if you've used 40 credits on the Free plan (50 credits/month) and upgrade to Pro with 100 credits/month, you'll have 60 credits remaining for the month. Your full 100 credits refresh when the new calendar month starts.
    <br /><br />
    **Note:** Upgrading from one plan to another does not give you additional credits beyond the total new limit. E.g., moving from 100 to 200 credits means your new monthly total is 200, not that you have an extra 200 credits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I just ran out of credits. How can I keep building?">
    Upgrade to a higher-tier plan to get more credits per month. Each plan offers progressively higher monthly credit limits.
    <br /><br />
    Selective edits (without AI, e.g., changing text on a page) don't use any credits.
    <br /><br />
    If you downgrade to the free plan after your app is built, Zite branding will reappear on your app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do unused credits roll over?">
    No, unused credits do not roll over. Each calendar month starts with a fresh credit limit based on your plan, regardless of when you upgraded or started your subscription.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel my subscription anytime?">
    Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, you'll continue to have access to your current plan until the end of your billing period.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you offer student or non-profit discounts?">
    Not yet, but we're considering special pricing for educational institutions and non-profit organizations in the future.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I refer friends?">
    Share your referral link from [here](https://build.fillout.com/home/affiliates) and earn credits when friends sign up.

    Visit our [password reset guide](/reset-password) for step-by-step instructions.
