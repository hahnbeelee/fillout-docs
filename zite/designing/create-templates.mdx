      title="Screenshot 2025-10-30 at 7.32.00 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"68%" }}
    />

    By default, your **Creator profile** will have the avatar and name saved in your account. Click `Edit creator` to change this.

      title="Screenshot 2025-10-30 at 7.32.10 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"69%" }}
    />

    A **Thumbnail** will be automatically generated for you app. You can choose to `upload image` to replace this. Click `Update` when everything's set.

    That's it! You have now created a template.
