## Overview

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGPLwb5v8sc" title="Zite Plan Mode" frameborder="0" className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen />

Plan mode helps you **scope what you want to build** before any changes are made. Like a Product Manager, Zite asks questions when needed, and then generates an editable plan.

Plan mode uses **[Zite Max](/zite/model-selection)** (the most capable model) to create a **plan document** summarizing what will be built, including scope, data, integrations, key assumptions, and what’s out of scope.

**When to use Plan mode**

- You’re starting a new app and want to **think through requirements**
- Your request is large or ambiguous, and you want a **clear scope**
- You need to align with teammates before building
- You want to avoid rework by deciding key details up front
