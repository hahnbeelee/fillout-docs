Plan mode helps you **scope what you want to build** before any changes are made. Think of it like working with a Product Manager: you describe the outcome, Zite asks clarifying questions when needed, and then generates a plan you can review and edit.

Plan mode uses **Zite Max** (the most capable model).

## What Plan mode creates

Plan mode generates a **plan document** that typically includes:

- **Scope summary**: a short restatement of what will be built, focused on the user experience
- **Data & integrations** (when relevant): what data sources, tables, fields, or endpoints are involved
- **Assumptions**: important details Zite is assuming (so you can confirm or correct them)
- **Out of scope**: what won’t be included

## When to use Plan mode

Plan mode is best when:

- You’re starting a new app and want to **think through requirements**
- Your request is large or ambiguous, and you want a **clear scope**
- You need to align with teammates before building
- You want to avoid rework by deciding key details up front

## How to use Plan mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Plan mode">
    Click the mode selector and choose **Plan** (checklist icon), or press `Shift` + `Tab` until you reach Plan mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you want to plan">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Answer clarifying questions (optional)">
    If Zite needs details, it can ask a few focused multiple-choice questions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and edit the plan">
    You can edit the plan inline to adjust scope, wording, or decisions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build the plan">
    Click **Build plan** when you’re ready. Zite switches to **Build mode** and executes what you approved.

## “Help me plan”

After a plan is created, you can click **Help me plan** to refine it. Zite will ask 2–5 quick questions to help finalize decisions before you build.
