## What is run history?

Every time a workflow runs, Zite keeps a detailed log of what happened. You can see the inputs, outputs, and each step in between—making it easy to understand what's working and debug what isn't.

<Info>
  Logs are retained for **90 days**.

## Viewing run history

Open any workflow and click the **History** tab to see all past runs.

  alt="Workflow run history"
  title="Workflow run history"
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

Each run shows:
- **Status** – Whether it succeeded or failed
- **Mode** – `Live` (production) or `Preview` (testing)
- **Time** – When it ran
- **Duration** – How long it took

Click any run to see the full details.

## Understanding a run

When you open a run, you'll see a step-by-step timeline of everything that happened:

<img

  alt="Run detail view"
  title="Run detail view"
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

- **Input** – The data that triggered the workflow
- **Database calls** – Records that were read, created, or updated
- **External requests** – API calls to other services
- **Output** – The final result returned by the workflow

If something went wrong, you'll see the error message and exactly where it failed.

<Tip>
  Click any step to expand it and see the full input and output data.

## Filtering runs

Use the filters at the top to find specific runs:

- **Mode** – Show only `Live` or `Preview` runs
- **Status** – Show only successful or failed runs
- **Time range** – Last hour, 24 hours, 7 days, etc.

Click `Clear all` to reset the filters.

## Testing with custom inputs

Click `Test run` to manually run a workflow with your own inputs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Test run">
    Open the workflow and click `Test run` at the top.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your inputs">
    Fill in the form fields, or switch to JSON mode for raw input.

    <img
      src="/images/zite/test-run-workflow.png"
      alt="Test run modal"
      title="Test run modal"
      style={{ width:"60%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a user (if needed)">
    For workflows that require login, select which user to run as.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run it">
    Click `Run` and check the result in your run history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Replaying a run

Want to run a workflow again with the same inputs? Click `Replay` from the run detail view. This creates a new run with identical input data—useful for testing a fix or reproducing an issue.

## Debugging with AI

If something isn't working, ask Zite for help. The AI can read your workflow logs to identify what went wrong.

Try prompts like:
- "Why is my workflow failing?"
- "What's causing the error in my getOrders workflow?"
- "Help me debug this endpoint"

When Zite requests access to your logs, you can:
- `Allow once` – Share logs for this request only
- `Allow always` – Let Zite read logs anytime (you can change this in settings)
- `Skip` – Don't share logs
