### What is REST API

A **REST API** simplifies interaction with your database data, allowing for automation and integration. Following RESTful principles, it seamlessly connects to retrieve, create, and modify database data.

### Introduction

The **Zite DB API** lets you access and manage your Zite databases programmatically, without using the Zite interface. The API is designed for developers building database-driven applications like CRMs, project management tools, inventory systems, and any application requiring structured data storage.

You can create databases, manage table schemas, define field types, and perform CRUD operations on records via the API.

**Zite DB** is a built-in database solution for your Zite apps that provides automatic schema management, real-time data operations, and a complete REST API for programmatic access.

### Field Types

Zite DB supports over 20 different field types to handle various data structures - from simple text and numbers to complex relationships. Each field type has specific configuration options and validation rules. See the complete [Field Types](/zite/database/field-types) for detailed information on:

- **Text Fields**: Single line text, long text, email, URL, phone numbers
- **Number Fields**: Numbers, currency, percentages, ratings, durations  
- **Selection Fields**: Single select, multiple select, checkboxes
- **Date & Time Fields**: Dates and datetimes with timezone support
- **Relationship Fields**: Linked records and lookup fields

Each field type includes template configuration options and record data structure specifications.

### Authentication

Generate and view your API key in the `Developer` [settings tab of your account](https://build.fillout.com/home/settings/developer). You can revoke or regenerate your API key at any time via the dashboard.

To authenticate your requests, you need to provide your API key in the `Authorization` header in the following format:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-api-key>` with the **API key** obtained from your Fillout account.

You can obtain your API base URL in the API dashboard. Typically, it will be [https://api.fillout.com](https://api.fillout.com/).

  **Important:** If you're self-hosting Fillout or using the EU agent, a different URL will appear in the dashboard.
</Check>

<Info>
  **Note:** The same API key used for Fillout forms also works with Zite DB endpoints.

## Rate limits

All endpoints are limited to being called no more than 5 times per second, per Account/API key.

## Error handling

All API errors return a consistent response format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable error message"
  }
}
```

### Common error codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INVALID_RECORD_ID` | Record ID is not in valid UUID format |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Requested resource does not exist |
| `BAD_REQUEST` | Invalid request data or validation failure |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Invalid or missing API key |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Server-side error occurred |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` | Feature not yet implemented |
