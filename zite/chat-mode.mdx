## Overview

Chat mode is a **read-only** conversation with Zite. Zite can explore your app and explain how it works, but it will **not make any changes**.

**When to use Chat mode**

- Understand your app (“How does this page work?”)
- Ask questions about behavior, settings, or flows
- Get improvement ideas before committing to changes
- Explore options (“What are a few ways we could add approvals?”)

## How to use Chat mode

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask your question">
    Enter your question in the chat box. Here are some good examples:
    - “Why is the dashboard loading slowly?”
    - “What happens after a user submits this form?”
    - “How do I change the wording on the login screen?”
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  If you like a suggestion and want Zite to implement it, switch to [Build mode](/zite/build-mode) and ask for that specific change.
