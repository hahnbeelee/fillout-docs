Chat mode is a **read-only** conversation with Zite. Zite can explore your app and explain how it works, but it will **not make any changes**.

## When to use Chat mode

Use Chat mode when you want to:

- **Understand your app** (“How does this page work?”)
- **Ask questions** about behavior, settings, or flows
- **Get improvement ideas** before committing to changes
- **Explore options** (“What are a few ways we could add approvals?”)

## How to use Chat mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Chat mode">
    Click the mode selector and choose **Chat** (speech bubble icon), or press `Shift` + `Tab` until you reach Chat mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask your question">
    Good examples:
    - “Why is the dashboard loading slowly?”
    - “What happens after a user submits this form?”
    - “How do I change the wording on the login screen?”
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  If you like a suggestion and want Zite to implement it, switch to [Build mode](/zite/build-mode) and ask for that specific change.
