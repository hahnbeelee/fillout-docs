## Quick fix

If you run into issues while building your app, here's how to resolve them:

**Fix or retry button**

When Zite detects a problem, it lists the cause in the chat and shows a toast notification with a `Fix it for me` button.

<Tip>
  Fixing issues with the `Fix it for me` button is free and won't consume any of your account's [credits](/zite/credits).
</Tip>

**Chat mode**

Build mode is the default, but if issues persist, switch to [chat mode](/zite/chat-mode) by clicking <Icon icon="message-dots" iconType="solid" /> on the bottom left. This lets you ask Zite what's going wrong without making changes.

**Recover feature**

If recent changes cause issues, restore an older version of your app. More info [here](/zite/history).

## Common issues

Here's a list of common problems and how to fix them:

**User Interface**

- Upload a screenshot or relevant image in the chat and describe what you want to do.
- You can also use selective edits to highlight a specific element and make changes manually or with AI. More info [here](/zite/selective-edits).

**Partial generation**

- The AI may struggle with multiple requests in a single message (e.g., listing 7+ tasks). Break your requests into 3 or fewer per message for best results.

**Failed App creation ("No app created yet")**

- This usually happens due to a temporary connection issue. Try refreshing the page.
- Alternatively, go back to your dashboard and re-open the app.

**Rate limits or tool errors ("Too many requests" or "Timeout")**

- This usually happens when too many changes are requested in a short time. Exit and re-open the app after a few minutes.
- Check error messages to see if the issue comes from Zite or an [external integration](/zite/integrations).
- We recommend using Zite's built-in database to help the AI understand your data better and reduce integration errors.

## Tips

Follow these tips for a smoother app-building experience:

1. Write clear, descriptive prompts. Call out the exact page, section, or component.
2. Include specific details and examples. Images work great.
3. Describe the user experience. Explain what should happen on clicks, submits, or navigation.
3. Limit requests to a maximum of 3 per message.
4. Avoid contradictory instructions. Put them in separate messages.
