## Quick fix

Zite uses AI to help you build fully functional apps without coding, but even advanced tools can run into the occasional hiccup. Here’s how to quickly sort out general issues:

**Fix or retry button**

When Zite detects a problem, it lists the cause in the chat and shows a toast notification with a `Retry build` or `Fix it for me` button.  

<Warning>
  Rebuilding or fixing uses credits. If you’re unsure or want to avoid repeated rebuilds, try **chat mode** instead.
</Warning>

**Chat mode**

Build mode is the default, but if issues persist, switch to chat mode by clicking <Icon icon="message-dots" iconType="solid" /> on the bottom right. This lets you ask AI what’s going wrong without making further changes.

**Recover feature**

If recent changes cause issues, restore an older version of your app. More info [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/history).

## Common issues

Here’s a list of common problems and how to fix them:

**User Interface**

- Upload a screenshot or relevant image in the chat and describe what you want to do.
- You can also use selective edits to highlight a specific element and make changes manually or with AI. More info [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/selective-edits).

**Partial generation**

- The AI may struggle with multiple requests in a single message (e.g., listing 7+ tasks). Break your requests into 3 or fewer per message for best results.

**Failed App creation ("No app created yet")**

- This usually happens due to a temporary connection issue. Refreshing the page.
- Alternatively, go back to your dashboard and re-open the app.

**Rate limits or tool errors (“Too many requests” or "Timeout")**

- This usually happens when too many changes are requested in a short time. Exit and re-open the app after a few minutes.
- Check error messages to see if the issue comes from Zite or an [external integration](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/integrations).
- We recommend using Zite’s built-in database to help the AI understand your data better and reduce integration errors.

## Tips

Follow these tips for a smoother app-building experience:

1. Write clear, descriptive prompts. Avoid vague requests.
2. Include specific details and examples. Images work great.
3. Limit requests to a maximum of 3 per message.
4. Avoid contradictory instructions. Put them in separate messages.
