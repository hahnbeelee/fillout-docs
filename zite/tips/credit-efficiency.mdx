## Overview

Each request you send uses [credits](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/credits). The amount depends on the complexity of your message. Here's how to use your credits more efficiently.

## Be clear and specific

When making requests, be precise with your instructions. If you want to change a specific feature, area, or page, indicate exactly which one. Avoid general requests.

  Add a search bar to the top right of the dashboard. It should filter the table below in real-time and match the current design of the dashboard.

It also helps the AI to upload images as references or examples, which can be especially useful when troubleshooting.

## Use chat mode

Building uses credits, but chatting doesn't. To review recent changes, troubleshoot, ask questions, or just have a discussion, click the chat icon in the bottom right.

/>

## Make manual edits

Small and minor changes can often be done without request prompts. These do not consume any credits. Here are common ones that can be tweaked with [selective edits](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/selective-edits):

- Rewrite text
- Change text size, weight, alignment, color, shadows, and opacity
- Change background color and opacity
- Edit a button or other element's color, rounding, and padding
- Delete text or elements

/>

You can also switch to [design mode](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/design#choose-a-theme) to make these changes:

- Apply a new theme from our library
- Change multiple colors at once
- Change font

## Avoid rebuilds

Fixing also uses credits, and rebuilding the same thing repeatedly can add up. To avoid this, switch to chat mode first to identify the error and next best step. Then, try making revisions manually before [requesting AI to fix it](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/tips/troubleshooting).
