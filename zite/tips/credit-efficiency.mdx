## Overview

Each request you send uses [credits](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/credits). The amount depends on the complexity of your message. Here's how to use your credits more efficiently.

## Be clear and specific

When making requests, be precise with your instructions. If you want to change a specific feature, area, or page, indicate exactly which one. Avoid general requests.

  Add a search bar to the top right of the dashboard. It should filter the table below in real-time and match the current design of the dashboard.

It also helps the AI to upload images as references or examples, which can be especially useful when troubleshooting.

## Use chat mode

Chatting uses fewer credits than building. To review recent changes, troubleshoot issues, or ask questions, click the chat icon in the bottom left. More info [here](/zite/chat-mode).

## Use plan mode

For large or complex requests, use [plan mode](/zite/plan-mode) to scope out requirements before building. This avoids wasted credits on rework by clarifying what will be built upfront.

## Make manual edits

Small and minor changes can often be done without request prompts. These do not consume any credits. Here are common ones that can be tweaked with [selective edits](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/selective-edits):

- Rewrite text
- Change text size, weight, alignment, color, shadows, and opacity
- Change background color and opacity
- Edit a button or other element's color, rounding, and padding
- Delete text or elements

You can also switch to [design mode](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/design#choose-a-theme) to make these changes:

- Apply a new theme from our library
- Change multiple colors at once
- Change font
