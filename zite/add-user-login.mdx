## What is user login?

User login controls who can access your app. Zite handles authentication for you and connects to your existing user database (Airtable, Google Sheets, Zite Database, etc.).

Zite includes enterprise-grade authentication with:

- Email/password login
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

    <Tip>
      While editing your app, you can select which user to log in as from a dropdown populated by your connected database. In the published version, however, users will need to enter their email address (or use Google) to log in. The user list will not be visible in the live app.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage users">
    Use the **Users** tab to view user sessions. To add, edit, or remove users, make changes in your `Database` (e.g., Zite Database or Airtable) directly from the top menu or by clicking `Manage users`.
