Zite has three editor modes. Choosing the right one for different tasks will help you build more effectively and avoid accidental changes.

## Pick the right mode

| Mode | Best for | Makes changes? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Build mode** | Making changes to your app | ✅ Yes |
| **Plan mode** | Scoping first, clarifying requirements | ❌ No (creates a plan) |
| **Chat mode** | Asking questions, getting suggestions | ❌ No |

<Tip>
  For big projects or uncertain requirements, start in **Plan mode**. This will help you scope out the project and get a clear plan before building.

## How to switch modes

You can switch modes from anywhere in the editor:

- **Use the mode selector**: Click the mode button (it shows the current mode's icon), then choose **Build**, **Plan**, or **Chat**.
- **Use a keyboard shortcut**: Press `Shift` + `Tab` (while focused in the chat input) to cycle modes: **Build → Plan → Chat**. Or press `Cmd/Ctrl` + `.` to toggle between modes.


## Creating a new app (Build it vs Plan it)

When you create a new Zite, you’ll see two options:

- **Build it**: Start building immediately (Build mode)
- **Plan it**: Create a plan first, then build it (Plan mode)

The same shortcuts (`Shift` + `Tab`, `Cmd/Ctrl` + `.`) work on the creation screen too.
