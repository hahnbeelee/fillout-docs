## Overview

Creating an app involves more than just building. It also includes planning and asking questions. Zite has three editor modes. Choosing the right one for different tasks will help you build more effectively and avoid accidental changes.

## Pick the right mode

| Mode           | Best for                              | Makes changes?        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Build mode** | Actively developing your app          | ✅ Yes                 |
| **Plan mode**  | Scoping and clarifying requirements   | ❌ No (creates a plan) |
| **Chat mode**  | Asking questions, getting suggestions | ❌ No                  |

<Tip>
  For big projects or uncertain requirements, start in **Plan mode**. This will help you scope out the project and get a clear plan before building.
</Tip>

## How to switch modes

On the Zite app editor, click `Build` on the lower left followed by your preferred mode.

  title="Screenshot2026 01 09at3 25 07PM 5"
  style={{ width:"45%" }}
/>

Alternatively, you can press `Shift` + `Tab` or `Cmd/Ctrl` + `. `on your keyboard.

## Creating a new app

When you create a new Zite, you’ll see two options:

- **Build it**: Start building immediately
- **Plan it**: Create a plan first, then build it

  style={{ width:"83%" }}
/>

The same shortcuts (`Shift` + `Tab`, `Cmd/Ctrl` + `.`) work on the initial creation screen too.
