## Mode-based model behavior

Certain editor modes automatically use **Zite Max** regardless of your selected model:

| Mode           | Model used             |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Build mode** | Your selected model    |
| **Plan mode**  | Always uses Zite Max   |
| **Chat mode**  | Always uses Zite Max   |

This ensures that planning and conversational tasks benefit from the highest level of reasoning.

## Credit consumption

Different models consume credits at different rates based on their underlying AI costs:

- **Zite Mini**: Most cost-efficient (lowest credit usage per message)
- **Zite Pro**: Moderate credit usage (balanced)
- **Zite Max**: Higher credit usage (premium intelligence)
