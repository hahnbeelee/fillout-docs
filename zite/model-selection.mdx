**Zite Pro** (_Powered by Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5)_

The **default model** that offers the best balance of speed and intelligence. Recommended for most tasks, including adding features, fixing bugs, and updating designs.

**Zite Max** (_Powered by Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5)_

## Mode-based model behavior

Certain editor modes automatically use **Zite Max** regardless of your saved or selected model:

| Mode           | Model used           |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| **Build mode** | Your selected model  |
| **Plan mode**  | Always uses Zite Max |
| **Chat mode**  | Always uses Zite Max |

This ensures that planning and conversational tasks benefit from the highest level of reasoning.
