## Overview

When building a Zite app, you provide instructions by sending messages or prompts. Each message helps Zite understand your request and generate the right output. Sending messages uses credits, and your credit balance determines how much you can build, update, and modify your app.

## Credit usage

The amount of credits consumed per message depends on the complexity of the request. Simple edits use fewer credits, while complex or advanced changes use more. Credit usage is based on AI LLM activity, including task complexity, the number of files read, and the number of changes written.

Summarizing chat history and manual changes, such as [selective edits](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/selective-edits) and [applying a new theme](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/design#choose-a-theme), do not consume credits.

| Sample request                      | What it does                                | Credit Estimate |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Edit colors, spacing, or font       | Small visual or style updates               | 0.5 - 0.7       |
| Reposition elements                 | Moves or resizes components within a screen | 0.6 - 1.00      |
| Change navigation or page branching | Updates flow between screens                | 1.00 - 1.50     |
| Add a new page or view              | Creates a new screen with elements          | 1.50 - 2.25     |
| Modify app layout                   | Updates structure across a screen           | 1.50 - 2.50     |
| Create a database                   | Sets up a database with tables and fields   | 2.00 - 3.00     |
| Change design from uploaded photo   | Analyzes a photo and updates app styling    | 2.00 - 3.50     |
| Add user authentication             | Creates flows, logic, and UI                | 2.50 - 3.50     |

<Warning>
  The credit usage shown above is an estimate. The total credits consumed may vary depending on the size of your app.

## Unused credits

Unused monthly credits expire at the start of each month. Each month begins with a fresh credit limit.

## Add more credits

If you need more credits, you can **upgrade your Apps plan**. Check out [this quick guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/subscription).

### Downgrading after deployment

If you upgrade to a paid plan to create an app and then downgrade after your app is fully built and published:

- Zite will continue to host your app on the Free plan as long as you're not using a custom domain.
- The app creator and the app users can still access the app free of charge.
- Zite branding will reappear if you go back to the Free Zite plan.
