## Overview

When building a Zite app, you provide instructions by sending messages or prompts. Each message helps Zite understand your request and generate the right output. Sending messages uses credits, and your credit balance determines how much you can build, update, and modify your app.

## Credit usage

The amounts of credits consumed per message depends on the complexity of the request. Simple edits use fewer credits, while complex or advanced changes use more. Credit usage is based on AI LLM activity, including task complexity, the number of files read, and the number of changes written.

Summarizing chat history and manual changes, such as [selective edits](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/selective-edits) and [applying a new theme](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/design#choose-a-theme), do not consume credits.

| Sample request                      | What it does                                | Credit Estimate |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Edit colors, spacing, or font       | Small visual or style updates               | 0.5 - 0.7       |
| Reposition elements                 | Moves or resizes components within a screen | 0.6 - 1.00      |
| Change navigation or page branching | Updates flow between screens                | 1.00 - 1.50     |
| Add a new page or view              | Creates a new screen with elements          | 1.50 - 2.25     |
| Modify app layout                   | Updates structure across a screen           | 1.50 - 2.50     |
| Create a database                   | Sets up a database with tables and fields   | 2.00 - 3.00     |
| Change design from uploaded photo   | Analyzes a photo and updates app styling    | 2.00 - 3.50     |
| Add user authentication             | Creates flows, logic, and UI                | 2.50 - 3.50     |

## Unused credits

Unused monthly credits expire at the start of each month. Each month begins with a fresh credit limit.

## Add more credits

If you need more credits, you can **upgrade your Apps plan**. Check out [this quick guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/zite/subscription).

### Downgrading after deployment

If a user upgrades to a paid plan to create an app and then downgrades after their app is fully built and published:

- The app continues to stay hosted on Zite without issues on the Free plan as long as they’re not using a custom domain.
- Zite branding will reappear if the user goes back to the Free Zite plan.
