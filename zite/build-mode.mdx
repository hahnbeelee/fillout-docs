Build mode is where Zite **makes changes** to your app. This is the default mode when you’re building features, fixing issues, or updating design.

## When to use Build mode

Use Build mode when you want Zite to:

- **Add or change features** (new pages, components, workflows, etc.)
- **Fix bugs** or unexpected behavior
- **Update styling** (layout, colors, text, spacing)
- **Set up integrations** (databases, APIs, automations)
- **Apply a plan** you created in Plan mode
- **Make any other changes** to your app



## How to use Build mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Build mode">
    Click the mode selector and choose **Build** (hammer icon), or press `Shift` + `Tab` until you reach Build mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the change you want">
    Include the outcome and where it should happen. For example:
    - “Add a button to the dashboard that creates a new record”
    - “Make the header sticky and reduce its height”
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the result">
You can always undo changes to return to your app's previous state.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for better results

- **Be specific about location**: which page, section, or component you mean.
- **Describe the user experience**: what should happen when someone clicks, submits, or navigates.
- **Share examples**: “Make it look like the button on the Settings page.”

<Info>
  Want to scope first? Switch to [Plan mode](/zite/plan-mode) to create a plan document before building.
