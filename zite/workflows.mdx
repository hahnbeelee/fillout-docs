## What are workflows?

Workflows are the backend logic that powers your Zite apps. They let you:

- **Connect to databases:** Read and write data from Zite Database, Airtable, Google Sheets, and more
- **Send messages:** Trigger Slack notifications or send emails (coming soon)
- **Run AI operations:** Generate text, images, or structured data with OpenAI
- **Process data:** Transform, filter, and combine data from multiple sources
- **Call external APIs:** Connect to third-party services

<Note>
  Workflows are sometimes called **endpoints** or **API routes**.
</Note>

## Create workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the logic">
    Tell Zite what you want the workflow to do. For example:

    ```
    Create a workflow that searches for products by name 
    and returns matching results with their prices.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect integrations">
    If the workflow needs access to a service (like Slack or Airtable), Zite will prompt you to `+ Connect` it.

    <img
      src="/images/zite/workflow-connect-integration.png"
      alt="Connect integration prompt"
      style={{ width:"65%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and test">
    Zite generates the workflow and shows you a visual preview of what it does. Use `Test run` to verify it works as expected. More info [here](/zite/workflow-run-history#test-runs).

  For authenticated workflows, choose which user context to test with

<img
  src="/images/zite/test-run-workflow.png"
  alt="Test run modal"
  title="Test run modal"
  style={{ width:"75%" }}
/>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Be specific in your prompts. Instead of "save user data," try "when a user submits the form, create a new record in the Contacts table with their name and email."
</Tip>

## Available integrations

Workflows can connect to these services out of the box:

| Integration       | What you can do                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zite Database** | Create, read, update, and delete records in your built-in database         |
| **Airtable**      | Create, read, update, and delete records in your Airtable bases and tables |
| **Google Sheets** | Read rows, append data, and update spreadsheets                            |
| **Slack**         | Send messages to channels or users                                         |
| **OpenAI**        | Generate text, images, or structured data with AI                          |

Learn how to link your accounts and use integrations in your app [here](/zite/integrations).

## View workflows

Click `Workflows` see all workflows in your app. Each workflow shows a **name**, its **description**, **apps** it uses (Database, Slack, OpenAI, etc.), and who has **access**.

<img
  src="/images/zite/workflows-list.png"
  alt="Workflows list"
  title="Workflows list"
  style={{ width:"70%" }}
/>

Click any workflow to open the editor, where you can view the code, see a visual preview, or check the run history.

- **Name** – The workflow's identifier
- **Description** – What the workflow does
- **Integration icons** – Which services the workflow uses 

<img
  src="/images/zite/workflows-list.png"
  alt="Workflows list"
  title="Workflows list"
  style={{ width:"70%" }}
/>

Click any workflow to open the editor, where you can view the code, see a visual preview, or check the run history.

## Authentication

Workflows can require users to be logged in. When authentication is enabled:

- Only logged-in users can trigger the workflow
- The workflow has access to the current user's info (ID, email, profile data)
- Requests from non-logged-in users are automatically rejected

## Workflow editor

The workflow editor has three tabs:

| Tab         | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Preview** | Visual diagram showing the workflow's steps                             |
| **Code**    | The TypeScript code powering the workflow                               |
| **History** | Execution logs for debugging ([learn more](/zite/workflow-run-history)) |

<Tip>
  You don't need to write or understand code to use Zite Workflows. The code tab is there if you want to inspect or manually edit the logic.
</Tip>

## Streaming workflows

For real-time AI chat experiences, workflows can stream responses back to the user as they're generated—just like ChatGPT.

Ask Zite to "create a chat interface" or "add an AI assistant," and it will set up a streaming workflow automatically.

## Example prompts

Here are some prompts to help you get started:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database operations">
    - "Create a workflow to fetch all orders from the past 7 days"
    - "Add a workflow that creates a new contact when the form is submitted"
    - "Update the task status to 'completed' when the user clicks done"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notifications">
    - "Send a Slack message to #sales when a new lead is created"
    - "Notify the team in Slack when a new order is placed"
    - "Post to #support when a ticket is marked urgent"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI operations">
    - "Add an AI chat assistant that answers questions about our products"
    - "Generate a summary of the customer's order history"
    - "Create a workflow that categorizes support tickets using AI"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data processing">
    - "Fetch data from Airtable and sync it to Google Sheets"
    - "Calculate the total revenue from all orders this month"
    - "Filter contacts by status and return only active ones"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best practices
1. Keep workflows focused.Each workflow should do one thing well. Break complex logic into multiple workflows.
2. Test before publishing.Use the live app preview and test your app to verify your workflows work correctly.
3. Check the run history. When something goes wrong, the run history shows exactly what happened.
4. Let AI debug for you. Ask Zite "why is my workflow failing?" and it can analyze the logs to help.
