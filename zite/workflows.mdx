## What are workflows?

Workflows are the backend logic that powers your Zite apps. They let you:

- **Connect to databases** – Read and write data from Zite Database, Airtable, Google Sheets, and more
- **Send messages** – Trigger Slack notifications or send emails (coming soon)
- **Run AI operations** – Generate text, images, or structured data with OpenAI
- **Process data** – Transform, filter, and combine data from multiple sources
- **Call external APIs** – Connect to third-party services

<Info>
  Workflows are sometimes called **endpoints** or **API routes**.
</Info>

## Creating workflows

Describe what you need, and Zite's AI will build the workflow for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the logic">
    Tell Zite what you want the workflow to do. For example:

    ```
    Create a workflow that searches for products by name 
    and returns matching results with their prices.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect integrations">
    If the workflow needs access to a service (like Slack or Airtable), Zite will prompt you to connect it.

    <img
      src="/images/zite/workflow-connect-integration.png"
      alt="Connect integration prompt"
      style={{ width:"65%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and test">
    Zite generates the workflow and shows you a visual preview of what it does. Use [Test run](/zite/workflow-run-history#test-runs) to verify it works as expected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Be specific in your prompts. Instead of "save user data," try "when a user submits the form, create a new record in the Contacts table with their name and email."
</Tip>

## Available integrations

Workflows can connect to these services out of the box:

| Integration | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| **Zite Database** | Create, read, update, and delete records in your built-in database |
| **Airtable** | Create, read, update, and delete records in your Airtable bases and tables |
| **Google Sheets** | Read rows, append data, and update spreadsheets |
| **Slack** | Send messages to channels or users |
| **OpenAI** | Generate text, images, or structured data with AI |

## Viewing your workflows

Click **Workflows** in the top navigation bar to see all workflows in your app. Each workflow shows:

- **Name** – The workflow's identifier
- **Description** – What the workflow does
- **Integration icons** – Which services the workflow uses (Database, Slack, OpenAI, etc.)

<img
  src="/images/zite/workflows-list.png"
  alt="Workflows list"
  title="Workflows list"
  style={{ width:"70%" }}
/>

Click any workflow to open the editor, where you can view the code, see a visual preview, or check the run history.

## Workflow editor

The workflow editor has three tabs:

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Preview** | Visual diagram showing the workflow's steps |
| **Code** | The TypeScript code powering the workflow |
| **History** | Execution logs for debugging ([learn more](/zite/workflow-run-history)) |

<img

  alt="Workflow editor"
  title="Workflow editor"
  style={{ width:"70%" }}
/>

<Tip>
  You don't need to write or understand code to use Zite Workflows. The code tab is there if you want to inspect or manually edit the logic.
</Tip>

## Authentication

Workflows can require users to be logged in. When authentication is enabled:

- Only logged-in users can trigger the workflow
- The workflow has access to the current user's info (ID, email, profile data)
- Requests from non-logged-in users are automatically rejected

  Set up authentication for your app.
</Card>

## Streaming workflows

For real-time AI chat experiences, workflows can stream responses back to the user as they're generated—just like ChatGPT.

Ask Zite to "create a chat interface" or "add an AI assistant," and it will set up a streaming workflow automatically.

## Testing workflows

You can test workflows before publishing your app:

- **Test run** – Click `Test run` in the workflow editor to execute with custom inputs
- **Select a user** – For authenticated workflows, choose which user context to test with

<img
  src="/images/zite/test-run-workflow.png"
  alt="Test run modal"
  title="Test run modal"
  style={{ width:"75%" }}
/>
