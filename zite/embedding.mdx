## Embed your app

After publising your app, click `Share` in the upper right corner and choose `Embed`. There are four different types you can choose from:

- **Standard** – a block embed on your site with adjustable height and width
- **Popup** – a large on-screen popup that opens when a button is pressed
- **Full screen** – an embed that covers the entire screen
- **Slider** – a sliding panel from the left or right side of the screen that opens when a button is pressed

Adjust the properties as you see fit. Then, `</> Get the code`.
