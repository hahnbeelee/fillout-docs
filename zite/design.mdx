You can style your app by using AI with a reference image, selecting a theme, or starting with a template and editing from there.

## Enter a prompt

In the chat box, drag and drop an image or click the `image icon` to upload one. In your prompt, say whether you want the full design to match the image or just certain parts like fonts or colors.
