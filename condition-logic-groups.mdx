## Show based on a condition group

Click the question or field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to open the right-hand panel. Under **Logic**, `Set conditional logic` to `+ Add condition group`.

You can also hide based on a condition group. Simply switch to `Hide when`.

### And function

If you choose `and`, all conditions set must be true to show (default) or hide a field.

  style={{ width:"81%" }}
/>

For example, the "Would you like to join our newsletter?" question above will only `Show when` the respondent:

1. Answers "Yes, please" to "Do you like to get updates on our discounts and promotions?"

   AND
2. Is "18 years old and above"

You can auto-compute for the Age using a birthday field. Learn how [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/calculations#compute-duration).

### Or function

Now, let's use `or`. With this, as long as one condition is true, a question or field can be shown or hidden.

/>

For example, we'll the "How can we improve?" field will `Show when` a customer:

- Rates "less than 5 stars" on "How would you rate our service?"

  OR
- Rates "less than 5 stars" on "How was your shopping experience?"

### Nested conditions

You can also create a condition group using both `and` and `or` functions.

  title="Screenshot 2025-11-27 at 7.40.42 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"95%" }}
/>

For example, we'll make the "Would you like to further discuss in a call?" `Show when` a customer:

1. Rates "less than 2 stars" on "How would you rate our service?"

   OR

   Rates "less than 2 stars" on "How was your shopping experience?"

   AND
2. Opted to "be contacted"
