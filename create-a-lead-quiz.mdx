## Overview

Lead quizzes are a reliable way to collect relevant contacts for your sales or marketing efforts. They work by asking leads a series of questions and generating a personalized scorecard or recommendation based on the answers.

## How to build a lead quiz

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Quiz mode">
    Open an existing form or create a [new one](https://build.fillout.com/home/quizzes). Click <Icon icon="gear-complex" /> on the upper right area.

      title="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 4.55.39 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"34%" }}
    />

    Click `Quiz mode` in the left-hand panel to toggle the `Quiz mode enabled` switch.

    <Warning>
      Disable the **Show correct answers after each page** feature to ensure results are only accessible via respondent emails and custom end pages.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an email field and quiz questions">
    Go back to the form editor and add an `Email input` field followed by your preferred quiz question fields.

    <Tip>
      Rename each page as you add fields to make it easier to find them when setting up conditions by clicking <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose correct answers and score values">
    After adding a quiz question or field to a page, click it followed by <Icon icon="graduation-cap" iconType="solid" /> to open the answer key window.

    ![Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 5.38.31 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-10-15at5.38.31PM.png)

    Add a **✓** next to each correct answer and provide a **Score** value.

      alt="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 5.01.31 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 5.01.31 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"57%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize a quiz’s ending page(s)">
    By default, [ending pages](/ending-page) for quizzes will calculate and display each respondent’s total score. To hide this, click GEAR and disable `Show quiz score`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Show custom messages

For quizzes without right or wrong answers (e.g. "Which product is right for you?"), you can show specific text or media based on the respondent's answers.

![Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 5.21.46 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-10-15at5.21.46PM.png)

Click a field on the ending page, followed by its <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" />. Under **Logic**, set when to show or hide content based on answers.

### Show custom ending pages

Sometimes, multiple ending pages are easier to manage than one with too many hidden fields.

![Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 5.24.14 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-10-15at5.24.14PM.png)

Click `+ Add page` at the bottom to add more ending pages. Then, open [page logic](page-logic). Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> and drag the connector to the corresponding end page to set your conditions.

## Set up custom respondent emails

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a workflow template">
    Open form **settings**.

    Then, go to **Custom emails** to choose an [email workflow](/custom-emails). The quickest one is to create a **Thank you email**.

      alt="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 4.55.39 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 4.55.39 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"34%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit email contents">
    You can edit the default **Subject** and reference fields like score or name by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" />.

      style={{ width:"85%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit message (Optional)">
    Go to `Email` to edit the default message and reference fields. You can also [customize its style](https://www.fillout.com/help/custom-emails#style-your-email).

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-10-15at6.44.32PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 6.44.32 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 6.44.32 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"87%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add branches (Optional)">
    You can [personalize lead quiz notifications](/filter-branch-workflows#1530ee47667b80b5a331cff31ed5c22a) by sending custom emails depending on the score. First, add a `Branch` action to your workflow, then`Edit` to set up conditions.

    <Tip>
      If you prefer to send formatted emails with custom styles, use Fillout’s [Sendgrid](/sendgrid) or [Mailchimp](/mailchimp) integrations.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add calculations to ending pages and custom emails

Fillout’s [calculations](/calculations) features let you add, subtract, multiply, divide, or assign values from quiz answers (e.g. suggesting a daily caloric intake based on a respondent’s weight, height, and exercise frequency).

Open `Logic` and click `Calculations` to add dynamic values to an ending page or respondent email.
