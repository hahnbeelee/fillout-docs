## What is SendGrid?

[**SendGrid**](https://sendgrid.com/) is a service that helps websites and apps send emails to their users. It is handy for businesses and developers who want a reliable way to send emails, like signup confirmations or newsletters, to their users.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to SendGrid">
    Open your form. Click `Integrate` from top followed by `SendGrid`.

    Enter your **API Key** in Fillout. You can find this in the **Settings** section of your SendGrid dashboard. `Create API Key` on the upper right corner. Enter a **Name**, then go with the default `Full Access` permission.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose to send email with template">
    If you don’t have a template on SendGrid yet, select `Email API` on the left-hand panel followed by `Dynamic Templates` and `Create Dynamic Template`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    On Fillout, [link your form fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) to the corresponding fields in your SendGrid contacts. For example, link the email address to its respective field. Then, fill out the **Sender identity** section.

    You can personalize emails, by inserting dynamic data under **Template variables**. For example, we want the "Name" to change depending on the customer’s name. Once everything is set, click `Finish setup`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go! Simply `Publish` and share the link. Respondents will now receive the email template.

## Specify a condition

If necessary, you can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Click [here](/conditional-integration) to learn how to.

## Personalize your email in Sendgrid

You can use **handlebars** in Sendgrid to [pipe a respondent's information](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/using-handlebars) in the notification email. For example, we'll personalize the email by adding the respondent's name. Simply type `{{ name }}` anywhere on your email.
