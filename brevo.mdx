## What is Brevo?

[Brevo](https://www.brevo.com/) (formerly Sendinblue) is an all-in-one marketing platform that helps businesses manage their email marketing, SMS campaigns, and customer relationship management (CRM) in one place.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Fillout form to Brevo">
    Open an existing form or create a new one. Head over to `Integrate` and look for `Brevo`.

    Type your **API Key**. To view the instructions, click the link in the banner. Then, select a **List** to `Continue`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link form fields">
    First, select the `Email address` field. Then, `+ Add new` fields to map the corresponding **Contact fields** in Brevo to those in your form.

    Click `Finish setup` once everything is set.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! Click `Publish` in the upper right corner to share your link or embed it on your website.

    Now, every time someone submits your form, a new contact will be added to your chosen list. If an email already exists, the contact details will be updated.

    <Warning>
      If a respondent inputs a new email but uses a phone number that’s already on your list, Brevo will show an error.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Specify a condition**

You can choose to run your integration only when a certain condition is met. Check out the quick guide [here](/conditional-integration).
