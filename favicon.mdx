## What is a favicon?

A **favicon**, short for "favorite icon," is a small image or icon associated with a website. It is displayed in the browser's address bar, next to the page title in browser tabs, and can also be shown in bookmarks and history lists.

## How to add a favicon

From your workspace, click your `Account name` on the upper left corner followed by `Settings`. Then, `Upload` a **Favicon**.

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-12-11at5.09.57PMcopy.png"
  alt="Screenshot 2025-12-11 at 5.09.57 PM copy.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-12-11 at 5.09.57 PM copy.png"
  style={{ width:"85%" }}
/>

**Upload** your logo or icon. Alternatively, you can also copy and paste an image **link**. You're good to go! Your logo or icon will now appear on your forms' browser tabs and links.
