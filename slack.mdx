## What is Slack?

[**Slack**](https://slack.com/) is a communication platform designed for teams to collaborate and work together more effectively. It offers messaging, file sharing, and other features to help teams stay connected and productive.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Slack">
    Open your form in Fillout and head to the `Integrate` tab, then click `Slack`.

    Label your Slack integration, then `Connect to Slack`. The label you choose won't matter. It’s just for identifying which Slack workspace you connected to in case you reuse the connection on other forms.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a channel">
    Select the **Channel** from your workspace you want to send notifications to, e.g. #random or #general.

    `Finish setup` That's it! You will now receive notifications on the Slack channel whenever a respondent completes your form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Remember to `Publish` your form to make the changes reflect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Message formatting

### Send all fields to Slack (recommended)

The default option, `Send all fields`, sends form responses in a nicely formatted message in your channel. You’ll see responses like this in Slack:

<Warning>
  We recommend this option, since Fillout handles ordering the questions properly and you won’t need to make changes if you add more questions to your form.
</Warning>

### Send a custom message to Slack

Choose the other option, `Custom message`, if you want to specify the exact information that gets sent to Slack. Click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or type **@** to reference questions or fields in your form.

<Tip>
  You can format Slack messages using [Slack’s formatting markdown language](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages).

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
