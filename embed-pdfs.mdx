## Benefits of embedding PDFs

**Support your form with relevant documents, portfolios, reports, and more**

Attaching a PDF to your form allows you to provide more information about your form's purpose or content. For example, an interior designer attaching her work portfolio to a client inquiry form gives the respondent a better understanding of their service and expertise.

**Add consent forms, terms of service, and other types of agreements**

Let respondents view copies of agreements in your form to give them the information they need. You can also ask for their e-signatures on the same survey or form with Fillout's [**signature field type**](/esignatures).
