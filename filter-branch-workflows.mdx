## How to filter an action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a workflow">
    Click `Integrate` on the top menu of your form, followed by `Workflows`. Then, start with a `+ Blank workflow`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose filter as your action">
    First, choose a **trigger**. Then, select `Filter` as the first **action**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your condition">
    `Set conditional logic` to`+ Add condition`. Choose a question or field from the left dropdown, an operator from the middle (e.g., equals), and an answer from the right dropdown to trigger the next action.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your next action">
    Choose the next **action** by clicking <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="regular" /> under Filter. We'll send a message in `Slack` when a respondent RSVPs "Yes". Remember to `Test` your workflow first.

      style={{ width:"65%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! `Publish` and share your form. Now you’ll receive summaries of those who answered "Yes" to your form in your chosen Slack channel.

    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add a branch to your workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose branch as your action">
    You can also create different branches based on specific conditions. By adding a branch, you can ensure that the right action happens for each situation.

    After selecting your form **trigger**, add a `Branch`.

      src="/images/Screenshot2025-11-03at5.37.20PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 5.37.20 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 5.37.20 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"61%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your condition">
    Click `Edit` to set a condition, followed by <Icon icon="circle-plus" /> to define what happens when the condition is met.

    In our example, we’ll send a summary of the responses to Slack when a respondent RSVPs "Yes", whereas we’ll send them an email with a link to our fundraising page and newsletter when they respond "No".
