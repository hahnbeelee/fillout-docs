## What is Microsoft Teams?

[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software?ref=filloutforms-helparticle) is an all-in-one tool for teamwork, combining messaging, meetings, and file sharing in a single place for easy collaboration. Whether it's chatting, video calls, or sharing documents, Teams makes working together effortless.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Teams">
    Click `Integrate` on the top menu followed by `Microsoft Teams`.

    You will be redirected to Microsoft's log in page. Sign in with your account to continue, then click `Accept` to allow Fillout to send notifications to your channels in Teams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a channel">
    Select a **Team** followed by a **Channel** where you want notifications to be sent to.

    That's it! Every time a respondent completes your form, a notification will be sent to your Teams channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Message formatting

### Send all fields (recommended)

By default, form submissions will be sent in a nicely summarized format to your chosen channel.

### Custom message

Edit the default message and choose which fields will appear in your Teams notification. Reference fields in your form by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@**.
