That's it! `Publish` and share your form. You'll now receive an email each time someone submits your form.

## Enable integration error notifications

Sometimes, using third-party integrations can lead to unexpected errors. For example, their service might be down or take too long to respond. Fillout will still save all form responses, and it can also email you with details about the error!

From your dashboard, click your `Account name` at the upper left corner followed by `Settings`.

Then, toggle `Enable integration alert notifications?` to enter your email. Be sure to `Save changes`.

## Send custom emails to respondents

You can also notify respondents when they submit your form. Check out this [guide](/respondent-emails).
