## How it works

By default, Fillout emails the form creator when a meeting is booked, and Google or Outlook Calendar sends the respondent a meeting invite with details. If you’d like to also personally email your respondent, you can add a [custom followup email](/custom-emails).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom followup email">
    On the `Integrate` page of your form, navigate to `Workflows`. Choose your preferred template. In this example, we'll select **Thank you email**.

    \
    Alternatively, you can click <Icon icon="gear-complex" /> on the upper right corner. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your message">
    `Edit` the contents of your email. More details [here](/custom-emails).

    Click `Preview` to send a sample email to your inbox.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish your form">
    On your form editor, click `Publish` on the upper right corner to make the changes reflect.
  </Step>
</Steps>
