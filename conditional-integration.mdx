## What is conditional logic?

**Conditional** [**logic**]() allows you to make forms that adapt to a respondent's answers. Fillout lets you `Set conditional logic` based on:

- <Icon icon="file-lines" iconType="solid" /> - [previous form inputs](/answer-piping)
- <Icon icon="link" iconType="solid" /> - [URL parameters](/url-parameters)
- <Icon icon="calculator" iconType="solid" /> - [calculations](https://www.fillout.com/help/calculations#pre-fill-fields-with-a-calculation)
- <Icon icon="calendar" iconType="solid" /> - [custom dates](/pre-fill-dates)
- <Icon icon="user" iconType="solid" /> - [enriched emails](https://www.fillout.com/help/lead-enrichment#how-to-enrich-emails) with company information
- <Icon icon="graduation-cap" iconType="solid" /> - [quiz scores](https://www.fillout.com/help/make-a-free-quiz#advanced-quiz-features)

## How to specify a condition

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the integration">
    Head to `Integrate` and click your **existing** **connection** or connect to a new tool.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a condition">
    At the bottom, click <Icon icon="code-pull-request" />.

    <img
      src="/images/logic/image-2.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form"
      style={{ width:"90%" }}
    />

    In this example, we'll only add contacts to our [Klaviyo](/klaviyo) newsletter if they will attend the movie screening. Click `+ Add condition`. Choose the field or question on the left followed by the relevant option on the right.

    <img
      src="/images/logic/image-3.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the Integrate tab of a form"
      style={{ width:"73%" }}
    />

    That's it! Now, newsletters will only be sent to those who will attend the screening. Note that you can do this for any integration type, like [Airtable](/airtable), [HubSpot](/hubspot) and [many more](/integrations).
