### **What is OneDrive?**

[Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/onedrive-for-business?ref=filloutforms-helparticle) is a cloud storage service that allows users to store, share, and access files from anywhere. With seamless integration across devices and robust security features, it provides a convenient solution for storing and collaborating on documents, photos, and more.

## How it works

## Add a dynamic file path

You can categorize file uploads into folders based on your respondents’ answers. Toggle the `Custom subfolder and file name?` switch, then enter a name or click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to reference a field as the **Subfolder name**.
