## What is Mailchimp?

    <Warning>
      When creating your form, make sure to set the email, name, and other fields you would like to link to your Mailchimp mailing list to **required**.
    </Warning>
    Choose which **account** and **audience** you would like to create or update contacts in, then click `Continue`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    [Match the fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your Fillout form to the corresponding fields in your Mailchimp audience. For example, link the email address field by its respective question.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    `Publish` your form once everything’s set.

    That's it! Answers from new submissions will now appear in your Mailchimp audience list.

    <Check>
      If a contact with the provided email address already exists, Fillout will automatically update the existing contact's information.
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add tags

You can add Mailchimp tags to new contacts automatically to help segment your email audiences. `+ Add tag` and choose from the dropdown.

To add a tag to specific contacts, toggle the `Add contionally?` switch. `Set conditional logic` and choose when to apply it. For example, tagging users with their "Occupation".

Remember to click `Publish` on the upper right corner after making any changes to the integration.

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
