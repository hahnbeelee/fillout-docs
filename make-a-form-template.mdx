## How to create a template

First, open the form you'd like to turn into a template. Click `Share` on top followed by `Template`. Then, toggle the `Share as template` switch.

<Note>
  All templates should be set to **Public** for now. We're still putting the finishing touches on a better version of the private templates feature!
</Note>

Look for the **template icon** on the upper right to tell which of your forms are templates.

## Public templates

Public templates get an automatically generated landing page, like [this one](https://www.fillout.com/templates/flower-order-form), that you can share with anyone.

Contact [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com) if you’d like your template to be visible in the **Template Gallery**.
