## What is Linear?

[Linear](https://linear.app/?ref=fillout-forms-helparticle) lets you easily create and manage issues, sprints and product roadmaps. It streamlines your workflow with a fast, intuitive interface designed for modern teams.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Linear">
    On a Fillout form, head to the `Integrate` tab and look for `Linear`. Then, enter your **account name** to connect.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure new issue settings">
    First, select a **Team**. [Reference any fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your form by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@**. You can also type a fixed text for the **Issue title** and **Issue description**, if needed.

    Optionally select the **priority**, **status**, and **project** to create the Linear issue with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once you’re ready, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner and `Publish` your form.

    Now, you’ll see a new issue created in your Linear workspace every time someone completes your form.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create issues based on conditions

You can choose to create certain types of issues only when a condition is met. For example, create issues in different projects depending on what respondents specify in the form. More details [here](/conditional-integration).
