## What is Dropbox?

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) allows users to store documents, photos, videos, and more in your personal cloud storage space, eliminating the need for physical storage devices.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Dropbox">
    Go to `Integrate` from the top menu and click `Dropbox`.

    <Warning>
      This integration is only applicable to **file uploads**. When creating your form, make sure you have at least one file upload field.
    </Warning>
    Add a name for your connection, then `Connect to Dropbox`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map form fields">
    Choose which **Folder** you would like to store the files in. Under **upload fields**, `+ Add new` and select a **file upload field** from your form.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once everything is set, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner. That's it! Your form's good to go. `Publish` to reflect changes and share the link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add a dynamic file path

Categorize file uploads into folders based on respondent input. Toggle the `Custom subfolder and file name?` switch, then select a **Folder path fragment**. Enter text or click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to [map a field](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually) in your form. Let's choose "Name" for this example.

Now, when a respondent submits a form, their file upload will be stored in a folder under their Name. This means every respondent will have their own folder.

## Add subfolders

You can add a subfolder by typing **/** followed by a name of your choice.

## Personalized filename prefix

Similar to the steps above, enter text or click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to [reference a form field](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually).
