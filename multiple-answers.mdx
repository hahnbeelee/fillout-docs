Questions usually call for a single answer, but some questions can have more. For example, you might ask respondents to:

- Add multiple contact people or team members
- Provide several dates/times they’re available
- Enter multiple addresses or delivery locations
- Upload several files or images in one go
- List several items in an order (e.g., products, services, menu items)
- Register multiple participants for an event or workshop
- Submit several project ideas or proposals
- List multiple preferences (e.g., meal options, shirt sizes, topics of interest)

## How to request multiple answers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your question">
    Choose the appropriate field from the left side bar. In our example, we'll ask if they'll be bringing guests.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add supporting fields">
    Here, we'll collect the names and emails of their guests. [Duplicate](/duplicate-fields) the fields as many times as you need.

      title="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.27.17 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"85%" }}
    />

    <Note>
      \*\*Note: \*\*For questions that require many fields per person or item, we recommend using a [subform](/subforms).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use logic">
    Now, we'll make the form adapt based on their answer. Click a supporting field followed by its `gear icon`, then go to **Logic** in the right sidebar.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-08-15at5.29.41PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.29.41 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.29.41 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"91%" }}
    />

    Let's start with the name field. We'll make this field **Show when** they answer "Yes" to bringing guests. Do the same for the email field.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-08-15at5.29.55PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.29.55 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.29.55 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"46%" }}
    />

    As for the fields for guests 2 and onward, you can also set them to only **Show when** the previous guest field (name or email) "is not empty".

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-08-15at5.31.59PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.31.59 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-08-15 at 5.31.59 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"47%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it\! `Publish` and share your form link, or embed it on your website.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Let respondents select multiple choices

For questions where respondents choose from a set list of options rather than typing their answers, use a multi-select or checkbox field.
