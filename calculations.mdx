## Add a calculation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Logic">
    Click the `Logic` modal in the bottom-right of your form editor.

    ![Screenshot 2025-11-25 at 6.32.40 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-11-25at6.32.40PM.png)

    In the popup, click `Calculations` on top followed by `+ Add new calculation`. Enter a **Name** or label and choose the **Type**, which can be:

    - **Number** - for numerical results like price or score
    - **Text** - for dynamic text based on responses
    - **Duration** - for intervals between dates, like age or term

    />

    For example, let's compute the price for multiple orders of our mozarella sticks dish. This would use the `number` type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter initial value">
    Type the value you'd like to start with. Some common examples:

    - **0** - to add to a price variable as options are selected
    - **100** - to deduct points from a quiz
    - **Any arbitrary text** - for a **text** calculation, or leave empty

    In our example, we'll start with the quantity. Let's reference this by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> and selecting the field.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Define rules">
    Click `+ New rule` to determine how the initial value will change. A rule is made up of 3 main parts:

    - **Condition** - a parameter, than when true, performs the calculation

      (e.g. add x amount when a respondents selects "yes" to a previous question)
    - **Operation** - what to do to the calculation (e.g. add, subtract, multiply, divide)
    - **Operation value** - the value used with the operation (e.g. add x amount to your initial value)

    First, click `Set conditional logic` followed by `+ Add condition`. Select the question or field on the left, qualifier in the middle, and choice on the right.

    ![Screenshot 2025-11-25 at 7.17.23 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-11-25at7.17.23PM.png)

    In our example, we'll choose the "Appetizer" field. The calculation will start when "Mozarella sticks" is selected. Since we want customers to be able to add other appetizers if they prefer, we'll choose "has any" as the qualifier.

    ![Screenshot 2025-11-25 at 7.40.27 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-11-25at7.40.27PM.png)

    Our **operation** will be "multiplying" the quantity (initial value) by the price of the dish (**operation value**), which is "\$6".

    <Warning>
      Rules are applied in the order they appear. For example, the first rule adds 5, the second multiplies by 2. To change the order, just drag and drop.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your calculation">
    Exit Logic and click `Preview` on the upper right corner to check that it works as intended.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once everything's set, `Publish` and share or embed your form.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dynamic calculation

**Make the price dynamic**

After adding a [payment page](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page), type **@** or click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to reference a calculation. Now, the price will change depending on the customer's order.

**Display dynamic calculation in your form**

Anywhere in Fillout, you can type **@** to [reference previous answers or calculations](/answer-piping).

<img
  src="/images/logic/image-12.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the Logic tab of a form"
  style={{ width:"68%" }}
/>

You can [style this text](/themes) by highlighting it and changing the font size, weight, or color.

## Compute duration

Determine age, trip duration, warranty validity, and more with a `duration` calculation. Simply enter a date range.

## Pre-fill fields with a calculation

Much like how fields are [pre-filled](/prefill-fields) elsewhere in Fillout, you can reference calculations there as well.
