## What is a submission ID?

A unique **Submission ID** is generated whenever someone begins to complete your form. Submission ID's are randomly generated, like 6bcedd3a-fe26-4bcb-9ce9-d3850e38d42c.

## Send the submission ID to your integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your integration">
    First, navigate to `Integrate` tab located on the top menu, and choose the app or service you would like to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Submission ID on your Fillout form">
    Under **Mappings**, `+ Add new`. On the left, choose the field from your app where you want to save data, and on the right, click `Submission ID` from your Fillout form.

      title="Screenshot 2025-11-25 at 4.49.42 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"77%" }}
    />

    In this example, we'll save our form's Submission ID to a column in our Airtable base with the same name.

    <Check>
      If you're using Zapier or Make, you'll also see the option to reference the Submission ID.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish setup">
    Click `Finish setup` in the upper right corner. That's it! The Submission ID will now be saved to your integration. Remember to `Publish` your form to reflect the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search for a Submission ID in the results

Go to `Results` from the top menu. Click `Filter` and look for `Submission ID` in the dropdown. Then, enter the ID number.
