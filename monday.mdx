## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Monday">
    Open the Fillout form you want to connect with Monday, then click `Integrate` on the top menu followed by `Monday`.

    <Warning>
      When creating your form, make sure to set necessary fields you would like to link to your Monday columns to **required**.
    </Warning>
    Enter a `Name` for your Monday connection and your Monday `API Key`.

    Then, choose the **Workspace** and **Board** you would like to sync responses to.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields on Fillout">
    After finishing the setup, Monday columns will automatically appear as Fillout fields on the form editor. Simply drag these to your form from the left-hand panel.

    <Warning>
      You can only use a **column field** once. For example, if you used column field A in page 2, you can no longer use it in other pages.
    </Warning>
    Alternatively, you can go to the Monday connection in the `Integrate` page and manually map them. `+ Add new` Monday column on the left and select the corresponding Fillout field on the right.

    In the example below, we will link referrer column on Monday to the Referrer's Name field on Fillout.

    <Tip>
      You can click <Icon icon="arrows-rotate" size={12} /> on the right side to have the most recent changes reflect in **Mappings**.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    `Publish` your form. Now, answers to mapped fields will appear in the columns of your table on Monday.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Specify a condition
