### What kind of apps can I build?

You can build all kinds of apps that connect to your data. 

Common examples include:

1. CRM app connected to Airbase for data storage

Build a simple CRM to manage leads, contacts, and deals.
All data is stored in Airbase, giving you a structured, scalable backend without manual setup.
Easily search, filter, and update customer info, ideal for teams needing a fast, no code CRM.

2. Client Portal connected to Google Sheets for data storage

Create a branded portal where clients can log in to view updates, reports, or deliverables.
Connect it to Google Sheets so updates sync automatically, just update the sheet, and the portal reflects changes.
Perfect for freelancers or agencies who already manage client work in Sheets.

3. Employee Intranet connected to Slack which notifies you when someone updates the intranet

Build an internal hub for sharing resources, announcements, and onboarding docs.
Link it with Slack to get instant alerts when pages are updated, keeping your team informed without extra overhead.
Ideal for remote or growing teams.

4. A website with a Fillout form embedded that will notify you when someone complets the form

Launch a simple website or landing page and embed a Fillout form to collect leads or feedback.
Get notified instantly when someone submits the form via email, Slack, or integrations.
Great for lead capture, job applications, or event signups.
