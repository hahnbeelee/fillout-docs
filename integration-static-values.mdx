## Overview

In certain cases, you may want to save a fixed value to an integration instead of letting your respondents input answers to a field. For example, you might have a **single select** field in Airtable or Notion that should always be marked as completed when submitted.

## How to add static values (Recommended approach)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your integration">
    First, navigate to the `Integrate` tab on top and click Airtable or Notion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields on Fillout">
    Go to **Mappings** section and link Airtable (or Notion) fields on the left to the Fillout fields on right. In our example, we'll choose the Status field on Airtable.

    Then, select <Icon icon="pen-to-square" iconType="solid" /> to type a value you would like to use. We'll type Finished for this example.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-14at12.18.15PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot of the Fillout form creation page"
      style={{ width:"93%" }}
    />

    That’s it! Your form is good to go.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Remember to `Publish` your form to make the changes reflect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Hide field

Another option is to go back to `Edit` from the top menu. Click the field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to open the right-hand panel. Under **Logic**, toggle `Hide always`.

Now, the Status question containing the answer, Finished, will no longer be visible to respondents.

<Warning>
  If you’re creating an **update** form, you’ll need to use the **static value** approach described above instead.
