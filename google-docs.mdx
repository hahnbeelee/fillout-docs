## What is Google Docs?

[**Google Docs**](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) is a cloud-based word processing tool that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real-time from any device. Part of Google Workspace, it's known for its ease of use, seamless collaboration features, and integration with other Google services.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Google">
    Open your Fillout form or create a new one. Under `Integrate` from the top menu, click `Google Docs`.

    Then, `Sign in with Google` to authorize access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a folder and set a format">
    Choose which **Folder** you’d like to store submissions in. Then, type a **File name** or reference fields in your form by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@**.

    You can choose to customize the format of the Google Docs by clicking `Custom message` to only include relevant fields. Type keywords and reference fields by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@**.

      style={{ width:"76%" }}
    />

    To format the text, **highlight** it. Then, click `Finish setup` in the upper right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share your form">
    `Preview` your form to test it out. Once everything’s set, click `Publish` and share the link or embed your form anywhere.

    That’s it! Now every time a form is submitted, a new Google Doc will appear in your chosen folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>
