## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to update mode">
    Open your [Airtable form](https://www.fillout.com/help/airtable). Click `Integrate` on the top menu followed by `Airtable`.

    Then specify that you want to `Update record`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use a formula">
    Create a new `formula` field and copy the formula Fillout provides on the `Integrate` page.

      alt="Screenshot of the Form designer tab of a form"
      style={{ width:"67%" }}
    />
    
    You’ll now get a formula that defines a unique link for every record in your table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it! Click `Update` in the upper right corner. Then, Try out your form in `Preview` mode, or click one of your unique links to update a record after you’ve published your form!

    Your form is **automatically pre-filled** for whichever record it is updating. This can be changed in the top right area.

    When everything's all good, `Publish` your form to reflect the changes.
    
    <Note>
      If you don’t provide an **id** in the unique URL, the form will create a new record instead.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Let respondents choose a record to update

Use [this approach](/choose-record-to-update) if you prefer to let respondents choose (in Fillout) which record they’d like to update.

## Advanced next steps (Optional)

You can use update forms in combination with products like Airtable interfaces, Softr, or Stacker. For example, instead of adding a formula in Step 2 above, we could add a `Button` field.

<img
  src="/images/uat4.png"
  alt="Screenshot of the Form designer tab of a form"
  style={{ width:"63%" }}
/>

Then, we can display this button in an Airtable interface, for users to easily edit the record.
