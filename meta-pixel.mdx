## What is a Meta Pixel?

A [**Meta Pixel**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/742478679120153?id=1205376682832142) lets you track user behavior, like when a user opens a webpage. You can add tracking pixels on Facebook business accounts, and then use them in your Fillout forms!

<Info>
  This feature is available on **Business**, and **Enterprise** plans. Learn more about our pricing plans and advanced features [**here**](https://www.fillout.com/pricing).

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share your form">
    That's it! Click `Publish` in the upper right corner.

    When someone submits your form with your public form link, you will get events in your Events Manager, which look like the image below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to check event details

On Meta Business Suite, if you click on one of the generated **Fillout events** (**Fillout.FormPageViewed** or **Fillout.FormSubmitted**) you will be able to `View details`.

In **Recent Activities**, you can see parameters that were passed to the pixel.

- **content_category** - the form's unique ID
- **value** - the page ID that the user saw found at the end of the URL (e.g., https://app.fillout.com/editor/85jZPR1kPsus/edit/85jZPR1kPsus)

<Note>
  It can take up between 2 to 5 minutes for new events to show up in your Events Manager.
</Note>

If you need to be GDPR compliant, you will want to [display a cookie banner](https://www.fillout.com/help/cookie-consent#enable-cookie-consent) on the form, which can be toggled in the form settings.
