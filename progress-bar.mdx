## What is a progress bar?

A **progress bar** lets respondents know how much of the form have been completed and how much remains. By default, respondents will see a progress bar at top of the form.

## How to change the color

Click `Theme` to open the **Form designer**. Then, change the `Primary` color.

<Note>
  Changing the primary color will also update your button color. If you want your button to stay the same, adjust it directly in its settings. More info [here](https://www.fillout.com/help/button-types#customize-button).

## Use a multi-step progress bar

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a progress bar field">
    On the left-hand panel of your form, click `Progress bar`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize your progress bar">
    Click the **progress bar** to customize it. This will open the right-hand panel where you can configure its settings.

      style={{ width:"88%" }}
    />

    Your progress bar will default to 3 steps. You can edit their names and `+ Add new steps` if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference steps">
    Navigate to each page (except Cover and Ending) and choose which step they should go into in **Current page progress**.

      style={{ width:"89%" }}
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Remove the progress bar

If you used a multi-step progress bar, you remove it in the right-hand panel. Either way, you can click form settings on the upper right area.

<img
  src="/images/formsettings.png"
  alt="form settings.png"
  title="form settings.png"
  style={{ width:"35%" }}
/>

Navigate to `Form behavior` and untoggle the `Show progress bar` switch.
