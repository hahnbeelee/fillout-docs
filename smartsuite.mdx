## What is SmartSuite?

[**SmartSuite**](https://www.smartsuite.com/about-us) is a team-oriented work management platform that empowers groups to organize, monitor, and oversee workflows, projects, and daily assignments efficiently. It provides a centralized solution for planning and overseeing all your team's tasks and projects.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to your SmartSuite account">
    Head to the `Integrate` tab from the top menu, and select `SmartSuite`.

    Input your SmartSuite **API key** and **Workspace ID**. You can find your **API key** in your user profile.

      style={{ width:"55%" }}
    />

    Your **workspace ID** is the first 8 characters after https://app.smartsuite.com when you’re logged in. Refer to the [SmartSuite help center](https://help.smartsuite.com/en/articles/6096587-retrieving-your-api-key-and-workspace-id) for more info on how to find these.

    />

    Then, pick a **Solution** and **App** you’d like records to be either created or updated in and `Finish setup`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your fields">
    SmartSuite fields will automatically appear on the left-hand panel. Drag and drop these into your form.

    You can also [manually map fields](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings) in the `Integrate` page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it! New submissions will be added as rows in your solution. Click `Publish` to make the changes reflect and share or embed your form.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Fillout has many powerful features like [branching](/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.

## SmartSuite feature roadmap

The following SmartSuite fields are not yet supported in Fillout forms, but are on the roadmap:

Date range, Signature, Checklist, Social network, Rich text area, Sub-items, Time tracking, User(s), Availability status, Color picker, Full name, Duration, and Cross-solution links

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
