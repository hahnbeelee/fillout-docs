## Overview

By default, when respondents finish answering a page, they have to click a button to go to the next page. With **auto jump**, the respondent is automatically redirected to the next page after making a selection, without having to click a button.

<Warning>
  Respondents still need to click the **submit** button at the last form page to complete the form.
</Warning>

## How to enable auto jump

Open your form settings by clicking <Icon icon="gear-complex" /> on the upper right area.

  style={{ width:"37%" }}
/>

On the left side, choose `Form behavior` to toggle `Auto-jump to the next page`.

<Warning>
  This only works for form pages with a single question. The following fields are supported: Dropdown, Multiple choice, Picture choice, Opinion scale, and Star rating.
</Warning>

Remember to`Publish` your form to reflect the changes. Now, respondents will no longer need to click a button to proceed to the next page.

## Hide buttons

You can also create forms without buttons if you want respondents to focus only on answering. Click the button followed by its <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to open the right panel. Under **Logic**, toggle `Hide always`.

/>

<Warning>
  You still need to make the button at the last page visible so that respondents can submit your form.
