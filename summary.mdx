## How to view summary

Click `Results` on top followed by `Summary`. Answers are sorted by recency, with the most recent answers at the top. You can `Filter` responses based on answers or `Date range`.

<Warning>
  The summary is only generated from the latest 5,000 responses. Older submissions are excluded.
</Warning>

If an answer catches your interest and you want to see the respondent's full submission, click <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" />followed by `View response`.

/>

Aside from their answers to other questions, you’ll see submission details like what type of browser they used and when they submitted your form. You can also [delete unnecessary submissions](/delete-a-form-submission) from here.

## Visualize your data

Fillout helps you spot trends across your survey results. Choice questions are summarized with a bar chart. Change the view by toggling the `Pie chart` switch.

  style={{ width:"76%" }}

<Warning>
  For performance and readability, the pie chart toggle is only available for choice questions with 200 options or fewer and text questions with 20 or fewer unique responses.
