## Overview

Some choice questions can have more than one answer. For example, you might ask respondents to:

- Share their preferences
- Select opinions they agree with
- Choose multiple skills or areas of expertise
- Pick all the products or services they use or have used
- Indicate dietary restrictions or allergies
- Select topics they're interested in
- Mark all applicable symptoms or conditions
- Select preferred schedules or time slots

You can do this using checkboxes, a multiselect field, or a picture choice field.

## Add checkboxes

Simply click `Checkboxes` from the left-hand panel. Note that this is different from the checkbox field, which does not come with options.

## Use a multiselect field

Choose `Multiselect` in the left-hand panel. Then, add your **Options** in the right-hand panel.

  You can easily switch to checkboxes anytime by clicking the ⇄ icon and vice versa.

## Enable selecting multiple images

For `Picture choice` fields, you can let respondents select more than one choice by toggling `Can choose multiple` in the right-hand panel.

<Info>
  To let respondents choose from the same set of options across multiple questions, use a [choice matrix](/matrix).

## Request answers for open-ended questions

For questions without fixed choices, like guest names or multiple projects, you can use duplicate input fields and logic to collect answers. Check out our guide [here](/multiple-answers).
