## Overview

**Conditional** [**logic**](/conditional-hiding) lets your forms adapt to respondents' answers. By default, forms follow a linear path with a next-page button. With page logic and conditional steps, you can control how pages connect (e.g., skipping a page for respondents who choose a certain option), creating a more interactive and personalized experience.

## Edit page branching

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Logic">
    After adding the necessary pages to your form, click `Logic`.

    Let's say you want respondents to go to different pages depending on their answers. For example, we'll ask respondents what kind of company they work at.

    In this example, we want respondents to see different pages based on discount eligibility. With this, we’ll create two different **ending** pages (accepted and rejected). If they work at a non-profit, they'll also have to describe the organization.

    What we want to do is:

    - If they qualify for a discount right away (e.g., student) <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" /> show them the accepted ending page
    - If they work at a non-profit <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" /> show them the non-profit page
    - If they don’t qualify (e.g., private company) <Icon icon="arrow-right-long" /> show them the rejected ending page

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect pages">
    First, click and drag from the <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> connector of the page you want to connect, then drop it onto the target page. For example, we'll click connector "Info" and route it to "Rejected".

    `Set condition` to define when it will redirect to "Rejected". In this case, if it’s a "Private company".

    **Repeat step 2 for other scenarios **

    Finally, we also want to route respondents to the success page right away if they’re a student. `+ Add branch` to `Set condition`.

    We’re done! Now, respondents will get redirected to different pages depending on their answer.
