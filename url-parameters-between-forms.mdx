## Overview

When embedding a [subform](https://www.fillout.com/help/subforms#subforms) within a main form, you can pass field answers or values (e.g., name, email, and order ID) from the main form to the subform using URL parameters.

This removes the need for users to re-enter information. For example, you can:

- Pass a user’s name or email for additional details in a subform
- Transfer order or project IDs for tracking submissions
- Pre-fill contact info in follow-up or feedback subforms

## How to send data

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a URL parameter in your subform">
    Open your subform and follow the steps above. In our example, we have the order form as the main form and a subform for selecting products.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the parameter to your main form">
    Click the subform field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" />. Scroll down to **Advanced** and `Configure` the information you'd like to pass to your subform.

    To add a new subform field, check out [this short guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/subforms).

    Click `+ Add new` and select the URL parameter from your subform in the left. Then, map this to corresponding field in your main form.

      title="Screenshot 2025-11-10 at 5.47.58 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"59%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it! The field where you set the URL parameter as the default value will now be pre-filled automatically.

    `Preview` your form first to ensure it's working as you intended it to. Then, click `Publish` and share or embed your form.
  </Step>
