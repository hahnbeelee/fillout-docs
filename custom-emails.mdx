## How to send a custom email

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with a workflow">
    Click `Integrate` on the top menu of your form, followed by `Workflows`. Then, choose a template under **Notifications**. Alternatively, you may open a form's **Settings** page followed by **Custom emails**.

    Choose if you want to send one right away through a **Thank you email**, **Send email after delay**, or **Send email only if conditions match**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your email">
    Then, `Edit` the contents of your email

    Change the default details if you prefer. You can also opt to **Send email from** your SMTP server or GMail or Outlook account.

      title="Screenshot 2025-10-07 at 4.00.02 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"48%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference answers (optional)">
    You can also pipe answers, like First Name, by typing **@** or clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> and choosing the corresponding field or question.

      style={{ width:"90%" }}
    />

    [Calculations](/calculations) can also be used to insert dynamic text into your emails. Be sure to `Test` your email workflow before clicking `Publish` on the upper right corner.

</Steps>

### Send different messages based on responses

You can send a different message to a group of respondents depending on their answers. Choose **Send email only if conditions match**.

  alt="Screenshot 2025-06-11 at 7.13.02 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"45%" }}
/>

Then, set up conditional logic by choosing a question followed by a condition. For example, we'll send a custom email to those who responded Yes to Will you be attending the event?

<img
  src="/images/workflows/image-20.png"
  alt="Fillout Workflow"
  style={{ width:"68%" }}
/>

That's it! Now, only respondents who will attend the event will be receiving an email.

### Send emails after a specified duration

You can opt to **Send email after delay** and `Edit` how later you want to send it in minutes, hours, or days.

  style={{ width:"41%" }}
/>

## Style your email

To customize the look of your message, go to `Email`. Select your preferred **Style** and **Theme**. Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> to add more elements.

  style={{ width:"88%" }}
/>

To change the text formatting and color, or add a hyperlink, simply highlight any text.
