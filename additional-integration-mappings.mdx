## Overview

One of the most important parts of connecting to a database or integration is connecting your form fields so they’re actually sent to your database or tool when the form is submitted.

## Automatic field mapping

Fillout automatically pulls in the columns or fields from your database or integration and turns them into form fields. Once you link an integration, those **connected fields appear in the left-hand panel**, ready for you to drag and drop into your form.

When someone fills out the form, their responses go straight into the matching row or field in the connected integration.

## How to map fields manually

Follow this if you made a Fillout form with fields before connecting to an integration, or if you want to map newly added fields after connecting to one.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to an integration">
    If you haven't already, click `Integrate` from the top menu and connect your form to [Airtable](/airtable), [Notion](/notion), [HubSpot](/hubspot), or [other integrations](/integrations).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map form fields">
    In **Mappings**, `+ Add new` integration field on the left and select the corresponding Fillout field on the right.

    **or Connect fields**

    Click a field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to open the right-hand panel where you'll connect it to a column in your database or a field in your integration.

      style={{ width:"97%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once you've mapped the necessary fields, click `Publish` on the upper right corner, then share or embed your form.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating fields and options

If you’ve edited connected fields, added or deleted options, added more fields, or made any changes to your integration, simply click <Icon icon="arrows-rotate" iconType="solid" size={13} /> to relect the changes on Fillout.

**On the left-hand panel**

**On the Integrate page**

## Other Mappings

You might want to send additional information to Airtable, Notion or other integrations when a respondent submits your form, other than your form fields. For example, you might want to save:

- [URL parameters](/url-parameters)
- [Static values](/integration-static-values)
- Submission date
- [Fields from the record returned after logging in](/login-page)
- [Fields from a pre-fetched record](/pre-fetch-data)

You can create a field, and  [pre-fill](/prefill-fields) it with a value, then connect to your integration.

Click `Integrate` on the top menu and follow **step 2** above. For example, let's connect a URL parameter. We'll select the relevant Notion column on the left followed by the email parameter on the right.

Fillout lets you map:

- <Icon icon="link" iconType="solid" /> - URL parameters
- <Icon icon="calculator" iconType="solid" /> - calculations
- <Icon icon="calendar" iconType="solid" /> - dates
- <Icon icon="user" iconType="solid" /> - enriched emails with company informations
- <Icon icon="pen-to-square" iconType="solid" /> - static values
