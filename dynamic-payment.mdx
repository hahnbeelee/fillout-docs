## How to make your payment page dynamic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Logic">
   First, open an existing form or create a new one. Next, click `Logic` on the bottom right corner to add your **Calculations**. Check out this [quick guide](/calculations#9969fe70824745d4bd3b8ca72efcf0af).

Then, go to your form’s [**Payment**](/payment-page) [page](/payment-page) or make one if you haven’t yet. Add `Your product here` and its description if you prefer.

  <Step title="Publish and share">
    `Preview` your form through the upper right corner to test it, then `Publish` and share the link or embed on your website. That’s it\! Now, every time someone places an order, the **Product name** and **Price** will change depending on their choices.
