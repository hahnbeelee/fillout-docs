## How to make your payment page dynamic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create calculations">
    First, click `Logic` on the bottom right corner to add your **Calculations**. Check out this [quick guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/calculations#add-a-calculation).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit payment details">
    Go to your form’s [**Payment**](/payment-page) [page](/payment-page) or make one if you haven’t yet. Add `Your product here` and its description if you prefer.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference a product">
    Under **Product name**, type **@** or click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" />, then select the question or field where you ask customers to choose products or services.

      style={{ width:"82%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference price">
    Do the same for the **Price**, but this time, click <Icon icon="calculator" iconType="solid" /> to select the appropriate field.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    `Preview` your form through the upper right corner to test it, then `Publish` and share the link or embed on your website.

    That’s it! Now, every time someone places an order, the **Product name** and **Price** will change depending on their choices.

    <Tip>
      You can test your live form without getting charged. Create a 100% off coupon in Stripe, then enable the "[Discount Codes](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page#add-discount-codes)" option to apply it during checkout. Once testing is done, just toggle the discount codes back off.
