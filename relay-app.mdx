## What is Relay.app?

[Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is a tool that lets you automate workflows across different apps, with the option to involve a human in the process. Each automation or **Workflow** consists of a **trigger**, an action that kicks off your workflow, and **steps**, which are actions performed after a trigger.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Relay.app with Fillout">
    Sign up or log in to your [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) account. On the left-hand panel, click `Apps` to `Connect` your Fillout account.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a workflow">
    Go back to the home page, and, click `+ New workflow` on the left side. Then, `+ Add trigger` and search for **Fillout.** Click `New submission`.

    Next, select a Fillout **Form** in the dropdown menu. Then, `+ Add step` to select an action. Choose between apps, webhooks, AI, and more.

    Use `Human in the loop` to ask for approval or input from a team member via email or Slack message. More info [here](https://www.relay.app/features/human-in-the-loop).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your automation">
    `Start a test run`, and choose a form submission from the list in the pop-up.
