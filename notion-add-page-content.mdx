## Overview

Fillout lets you [add or update pages](/notion) in your Notion databases with modern forms, quizzes, or surveys. Typically, this means creating new entries in each column of your Notion database for every form submission. However, you can also add content to the body of a Notion page.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your form">
    If you haven’t yet created your form, follow the steps in [this article](/notion) to connect a Fillout form to Notion to create or edit pages.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Page content section">
    Click `Integrate` in the top menu and choose `Notion`. Here, you’ll find the option to reference information in your form, to create personalized content for your Notion page.

    In the example above, we inserted the user’s name, and their favorite Notion feature, in a survey we ran, as well as a helpful link. Simply click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or type **@** to insert answers to your form fields. More info [here](/answer-piping).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Style your text (Optional)">
    You can **highlight any text** in this section to style it before you’re ready to add it to your Notion page.

      style={{ width:"64%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! `Finish setup` and `Publish` your form, then share the link directly or embed it on your site.
  </Step>
