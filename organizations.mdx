## How it works

When you create an account, you set up your own **organization** to create various forms. You can invite others to join as [collaborators](/invite-collaborators) and control their access to specific workspaces with [granular permissions](/invite-collaborators).

## How to create another organization

On the upper left corner, click your `Account name` followed by `Create organization`.

That's it!
