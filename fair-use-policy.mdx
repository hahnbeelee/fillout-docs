Fillout operates on a fair use policy. This policy is designed to ensure the quality and accessibility of our services for all our users, regardless of payment tier. To provide a reliable and affordable service, we need to ensure that usage is kept within reasonable limits to prevent system abuse and maintain fair resource distribution.

## Sample scenarios of excessive usage

**Collecting large amounts of file uploads**

e.g. uploading over 50 GB of files per month or 300 GB of total storage

**Gathering a very large volume of submissions**

e.g. consistently receiving over 30,000 total submissions per month or exceeding 250,000 submissions in total (across all forms)

**Sending a very large number of emails**

e.g. sending more than 10,000 emails in one month.

**Building a very large number of forms**

e.g. having over 500 forms on a single account

**Submitting an unusually high volume in a short time period**

e.g. receiving over 1,000 submissions in a single minute, which may indicate automated abuse or system misuse

## What happens if you exceed the limits

If your usage exceeds the fair usage limits, you'll receive a notification via email, prompting you to upgrade your plan or take steps to reduce your usage. If usage continues to exceed the limits without any changes, we may need to temporarily limit or suspend your access to some features of Fillout.

  If you **expect to have consistently high usage**, reach out to us about a custom [Enterprise plan](https://main.fillout.com/enterprise?ref=fillouthelparticle-fairusepolicy) to support your needs.
