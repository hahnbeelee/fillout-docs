<Warning>
  [Event reminders](/scheduling-workflows#event-email-reminder-to-invitees) count as workflows, but they won’t appear on this page because they weren’t created as workflows initially. To make changes, use the left-hand panel of your form.

## Types of scheduling actions

### **Event email reminder to host**

Send reminders to yourself before a meeting takes place. By default, reminders are sent 30 minutes before a calendar event. To change this, `Edit` how soon you prefer to send it **Before event starts**.

By default, reminders are sent to the email linked to your Fillout account. To send them to another or additional email (e.g. for multiple hosts), `Edit` your email and toggle `Self-email`.

### **Slack reminder before calls**

Send a Slack reminder 5 minutes before an event occurs. `Edit` this default time to how soon you would like to send it **Before event starts**.

Connect to **Slack** by clicking `Edit` and selecting the **Channel** you would like to send it to. Edit the message and reference answers by simply hovering and clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@** and selecting the corresponding fields or questions.
