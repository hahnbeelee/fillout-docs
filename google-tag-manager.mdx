## What is Tag Manager?

[Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/?ref=fillout-forms-help-article) is a free tool that allows you to manage and deploy marketing tags on your website without editing the code. It simplifies tracking and analytics for better insights and optimization.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Tag Manager">
    First, open your Fillout form or create a new one. Then, navigate to `Integrate` from the top menu and look for `Tag Manager`.

    `Connect a custom domain` to get started. Follow the quick instructions in the next screen to enter your **Google Tag Manager container ID**.

    <Warning>
      Only [admins](https://www.fillout.com/help/granular-permissions#admin-vs-non-admins) will be able to add a custom domain.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add triggers">
    In your Tag Manager **Workspace**, head over to `Variables` from the left panel and click `Configure`.

    Then, go back to your **Workspace**. Click `Tags` in the left panel followed by `New`.

    In **Tag Configuration**, we’ll choose `Google Analytics`. Copy and paste the [**Measurement ID**](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356?hl=en) and enter an **Event Name**.

    Click `Save` in the upper right corner, then `Add Trigger`. Click **\+** on the right corner and set your preferences. In our example, we’ll fire the trigger when respondents click the submit button in the Fillout form.
