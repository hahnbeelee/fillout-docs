## How to add a payment page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a payment type">
    Click `+ Add page` and choose **Payment**.

    ![Screenshot 2025-10-01 at 5.52.03 PM.png](/images/Screenshot2025-10-01at5.52.03PM.png)

    Select between the following types:

    - **One-time** - for single, non-recurring transactions
    - **Subscription** - for recurring transactions usually with a fixed price
    - **Pay what you want** - leave the amount up to the customer

    <Check>
      Payment pages are available on all plans with no additional fees charged to use the feature. However, usual Stripe fees such as transaction costs still apply.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter details">
    Add the details of your payment page and `Connect to Stripe`. From here you can choose the currency, and make the price and product name [dynamic](/fetch-dynamic-data) by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@** to reference a specific field.

      title="Screenshot 2025-10-01 at 5.31.36 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"72%" }}
    />

    In this example, the product name and price will change per customer depending on their order.

    The default payment method in new forms is through a card. You can give more options to your customers by adding more **Payment** methods through the left-hand panel.

    <Note>
      **Note:** Fillout doesn't support automatically adding VAT to the prices, even if the option is enabled in your Stripe account. You can use [calculations](/calculations) to obtain a price with taxes included, and then use that calculation as the price in the payment page.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That’s it! Click `Preview` to try out your form. Payments will only be collected when you `Publish` the form and send its link.

    <Tip>
      You can test your live form without getting charged. Create a 100% off coupon in Stripe, then enable the "[Discount Codes](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page#add-discount-codes)" option to apply it during checkout. Once testing is done, just toggle the discount codes back off.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize payment settings

On the left-hand panel, you can:

- **Allow discount codes** - add a new code or link an existing one to your form by clicking `Manage discount codes in Stripe`
- **Collect email** - to create a new customer on your Stripe account
- **Pre-fill fields** - automatically fill out the fields of your payment form

  title="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1.49.01 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"54%" }}
/>

- **Show testimonial** - to help increase checkout rates
- **Show disclaimer** - to clarify terms and reduce disputes over returns, shipping, and other necessary info

  title="Screenshot2025-10-01at6.05.08PM.png.avif"
  style={{ width:"54%" }}
/>

- **Send Stripe receipt** - after a successful purchase. Be sure to enabled the [collect email](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page#create-a-new-stripe-customer) switch.

  title="Screenshot 2025-10-01 at 6.06.11 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"55%" }}
/>

Here's a sample of what it would look like. Note that receipts are not sent in Fillout preview mode.

  style={{ width:"63%" }}
/>

## Reference the payment intent ID in integrations

You can save the Stripe payment ID to the integration of your choice by referencing it. Go to `Integrate` from the top menu and choose a platform.

Under **Mappings**, click `+ Add new` and look for **Stripe Payment ID.**

  title="Screenshot 2025-10-01 at 6.02.44 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"58%" }}
/>

Stripe payment ids will look like "pi_3MKECGFiethEjGwr1TWmQ0rN" and allow you to tie a form submission to an actual payment in Stripe.
