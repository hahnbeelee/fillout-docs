## Overview

By default, when a respondent selects a choice, that same label appears in the `Results` page.\
For example, if they choose "Los Angeles International Airport", that’s what will show up in Results.

/>

By adding **Custom values**, you can change the text that will appear on the results page. For example, we can specify the value of the same choice, "Los Angeles International Airport", to be "LAX". This can be helpful when integrating your form to CRMs, databases or other tools.

<Info>
  This feature is applicable to Multiple choice, Dropdown, Checkboxes, Picture choice, and Multiselect field types.

Click an option to edit the **Value** as you see fit. Once the form is ready, click `Publish` on the upper right corner.

  style={{ width:"63%" }}
/>

That's it! Now you'll see the **Values** of the options in the results page.

## Use cases

**Studies and research**

In academic studies, use custom values to frame questions in a participant-friendly manner.

**Multilingual forms**

For forms in different languages, use custom values to show options in one language while your backend understands them in another.

**Order fulfillment**

For example, in an e-commerce form, use custom values to display product variations with user-friendly labels while maintaining specific backend values for inventory and processing.
