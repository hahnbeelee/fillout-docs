## How to send an org invite

On your dashboard, click `Invite members` in the upper right area.

  style={{ width:"36%" }}
/>

Enter the emails of the people you would like to invite. You can choose to invite them as:

- **Admin** - have full access to the workspace enabling them to view and edit settings
- **Member** - can create their own forms and scheduling links, but cannot edit anyone else's

The invitee will get notified through their email. Upon clicking the link, they will be redirected to a sign up page and prompted to join the organization.

<Warning>
  Invites sent expire after 14 days, however you may send them another invite after the expiration date.

## How to effectively work with collaborators

**View and discuss form submissions together**

Gain insights by analyzing data together as a team. Individual members can apply personalized filters to focus on desired analytics for tailored analyses. Additionally, they can [leave comments](/comment) and tag other users.

**Work on separate forms at the same time**

With multiple collaborators working in tandem, tasks can be divided and accomplished more quickly, reducing the time required for form creation and data collection. Collaborators cannot edit the same form at the same time, but can edit different forms simultaneously.

**Invite an expert to help build a form or consult on it**

You can invite consultants or anyone involved in your workflow to help build your forms. Note that consultants may also want to [import/export forms](/importing-and-exporting-forms) from their accounts instead.
