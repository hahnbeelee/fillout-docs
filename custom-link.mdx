## How to add a custom subdomain

Even without a [custom domain](/custom-domains), you can customize your share link.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open account settings">
    On the Fillout dashboard, click your `Account name` in the upper left corner followed by `Settings`.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-12-01at4.31.12PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 4.31.12 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 4.31.12 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"25%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize subdomain">
    Click `Change subdomain` and enter a subdomain you intend to keep in the popup.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-12-01at4.44.49PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 4.44.49 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 4.44.49 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"65%" }}
    />

    That's it! Now all your forms will begin with yoursubdomain.fillout.com

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-12-01at4.54.16PM.png"
      alt="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 4.54.16 PM.png"
      title="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 4.54.16 PM.png"
      style={{ width:"88%" }}
    />

    <Check>
      The original default form link will still redirect to the same form. There is no need to share the new customized link to those whom you have shared the original link with prior.
    </Check>
    You can also remove your subdomain here.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Edit the custom ending of your link

You can enter any text for your form link’s ending to personalize it. Click `Share` on top to `Customize` the slug.
