## Create a workspace

On your **dashboard**, hover and click <Icon icon="square-plus" /> to add a new workspace.

<img

  alt="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 4.37.21 PM.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 4.37.21 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"31%" }}
/>

You’ll now be redirected to your new **workspace**, which can also be accessed on the left-hand panel.

## Add a form to a workspace

Click <Icon icon="square-ellipsis" /> followed by `Move to`. Then, choose the workspace you’d like to add the form to.

  title="Screenshot 2025-10-09 at 4.40.39 PM copy.png"
  style={{ width:"67%" }}
/>

Alternatively, you can drag and drop a form to your preferred workspace.
