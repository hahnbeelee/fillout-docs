## Schedulers

Fillout has its own native scheduler (supported by Google and Outlook Calendars) and currently supports [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) and [Cal.com](https://cal.com/). If you prefer to use another scheduler, you can [request it here](https://forms.fillout.com/t/c85QiJrD7Vus).

### Fillout Scheduling

Select `Scheduling` to grant Fillout access to your Google, Zoom, or Teams calendar. Check out this [guide](/fillout-scheduling-intro) to learn more. Then, select a meeting type.

/>

### **Calendly setup**

`Connect to Calendly` and grant Fillout access, and **Choose event**.

### [Cal.com](http://cal.com/) setup

For `Cal.com`, copy and paste the link of your scheduling event. You can provide either the unique event or the full scheduling link.

/>

That’s it! Go to `Preview` mode in the top right corner to try it out. You can always change which event your scheduling page is linked to in the right-hand panel by clicking your calendar's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> icon.

On the Fillout `Results` page, you’ll see a **direct link** to the new scheduling event, tied to every submission.

## Pre-fill information

You can pass in information to the Scheduling question type using **Calendly/Cal.com prefills** in the right-hand panel. Click your calendar's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> icon to make the panel appear.

This is useful if you’ve already asked your respondent for their email or name, or if you’d like to pre-fill the calendar to a particular date.

  title="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 2.56.17 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"44%" }}
/>

Click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to select the value you would like to reference. In this example, we'll pre-fill their email.

## Save the booked time to an integration

You can save the Stripe payment ID to the integration of your choice by referencing it. Go to `Integrate` from the top menu and choose a platform.

Under **Mappings**, click `+ Add new` and look for the **Event URL** or other event fields.
