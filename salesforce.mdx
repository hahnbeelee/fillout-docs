## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your form to Salesforce">
    On the form editor, click `Integrate` on the top menu followed by `Salesforce`.

    Click `Connect to Salesforce` to sign in with your Salesforce account. Then, choose an **object** where you would like to store responses to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your form fields">
    After finishing the setup, Salesforce fields will automatically appear as Fillout fields on the form editor. Simply drag these to your form from the left-hand panel.

    Alternatively, you can go to the Salesforce connection in the `Integrate` page and manually map them. `+ Add new` Salesforce on the left and select the corresponding Fillout field on the right.

  <Step title="Publish and share">
    That's it! Click `Publish` in the upper right corner and share your link. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your Salesforce database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## IPs to whitelist

If your Salesforce organization restricts IP addresses for 3rd party app connections, you’ll want to whitelist the following IPs:

```
35.160.120.126
44.233.151.27
34.211.200.85
```

## Update records from a form

You can also create a form that pre-fills with Salesforce data and updates an existing record when submitted. Check out [this guide](/salesforce-update-form).
