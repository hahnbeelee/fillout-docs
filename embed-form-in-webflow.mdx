## Overview

While [Webflow](https://webflow.com) has some built-in form features, they have limited multi-step functionality and only work with a limited number of third-party apps and platforms, making it hard to sync data to your CRM, database, or email marketing platform.

## How to embed your form

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an embed style">
    Start by clicking `Publish` in the upper right corner of the Fillout form editor. A popup will show up where you can pick an **embed style**.

    If you've already published your form, click `Share` in the top middle or top right. Adjust your embed style settings to fit your use case. Then, `Get the code`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add elements">
    Open your Webflow visual editor, click `+` on the upper left corner (or press `A`) to open the **Add Elements** sidebar.

    Select the **Elements** tab, scroll to the **Advanced** section at the bottom of the list, and drag and drop the `Embed` to a spot on the page.

  <Step title="Paste embed code">
    Paste your **embed code** from Fillout into the code editor and click `Save & Close`.

    <img

      alt=""
      style={{ width:"85%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and preview">
    The Webflow visual editor doesn't display scripts, so you need to open the **Publish** menu in the upper right corner of the screen and click `Publish to selected domains`. 

    After publishing the changes, click <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" /> next to your site URL to confirm that the embed works as intended.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting common issues

**Narrow embeds**

Sometimes, design settings applied in Fillout cause the embed to show up as too narrow on the page. To fix this manually, select the `Embed` in the visual editor, then open the **Size** menu from the right **Style** sidebar.

Increase the `Min W` value, publish the changes, and keep adjusting until you find a value you like (500px is a good starting point).

**Out of place floating buttons**

Floating buttons (available in the **Popup** and **Slider** embed settings) may float behind certain elements and styles, like image sliders.

One way to fix this is placing the `Embed` element inside of a `Div` block (under **Basic** in the **Add Elements** sidebar) – almost anywhere on the page should work – and selecting `Relative` from the **Position** dropdown in the right **Style** sidebar.

Then, click on every `Slide` element on the page and select `Static` from the **Position** dropdown within the **Style** sidebar.
