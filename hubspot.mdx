## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your form in Fillout">
    On your [Fillout](https://build.fillout.com/home) dashboard, [create a form](https://www.fillout.com/help/make-a-form). Choose to `Connect` to HubSpot.

    Choose your theme (don’t worry, you can always change this later). Then, choose a **HubSpot** **account** to connect your contacts table to Fillout.

    <Note>
      Unable to connect? Try ensuring that you’re logged into the correct HubSpot account before connecting, and try again. Contact [support@fillout.com](mailto:support@fillout.com) for help.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map your questions">
    Fillout will pull HubSpot properties that will be shown on the left-hand panel of the form editor. Simply drag and drop these into your form.

    <Warning>
      Custom properties created in HubSpot should be marked to **Use in forms, and bots**, to use in Fillout forms.
    </Warning>

    To connect a new question or field to HubSpot, open the right-hand panel or go to mappings. Check out [this quick guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually).

    <Tip>
      To [update your Fillout form](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#updating-fields-and-options) with changes from your HubSpot contacts table, click <Icon icon="arrows-rotate" iconType="solid" size={12} />.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish & Share">
    Once you’ve finished creating your form, you’re ready to go! Simply `Publish` and share. Form responses will now automatically populate inside your HubSpot table. You can share the link directly, or embed the form on your site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Fillout has many powerful features like [**branching**](/page-logic) and [conditional hide/appear logic](/conditional-hiding). No matter how complex your needs are, there’s a way to build it in Fillout.

## Update existing contacts

Existing contacts will automatically be updated if the form is re-submitted with the same email as an existing contact in your HubSpot CRM.

<Tip>
  You can pre-fill your form if you already know information about your existing contact. For more info, see this [help article](/prefill-fields).
</Tip>

## Specify a condition

You can run your integration only when a specific condition is met. Check out this [guide](/conditional-integration).
