## How to choose a template

First, find the template you would like to clone [here.](https://fillout.com/templates) Then, click `Use template`.

Alternatively, you can `+ Create` a form and choose to start with a `Template`.

That’s it! You now have a copy of that template as a form in your account. Make any changes you need, [customize it](/styling), [connect an integration](/integrations), and [share or embed](https://www.fillout.com/help/sharing) once you’re good to go.

## Make your own template

You can even make your own template from one of your forms and share it inside or outside of your organization. More details [here](/make-a-form-template).
