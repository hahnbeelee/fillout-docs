## Overview

The **Analytics** section displays various metrics about your form, like completion rate, number of submissions, total views per page, and more. You can also see how many completed submissions your forms are receiving per day.

## How to view analytics

Open a form and navigate to `Results` on top. Click `Analytics`. Here, you'll see:

- **Unique Visitors** - number of individual respondents who viewed your form, each counted only once no matter how many times they visit
- **Started** - number of times your form was started but left incomplete
- **Finished** - number of times your form has been completed
- **Completion rate** - number of finished submissions divided by number of unique visitors

The chart above shows the total of number submissions on any given day since you first published the form.

## Check page drop-off rates

**Page drop-off rates** shown at the bottom help you determine if and where respondents are abandoning your forms. In the example below, the Overall page has the highest number of drop-offs.

<Tip>
  Double check form pages with high drop-off rates. To improve your conversion rates, make sure that questions are worded clearly, and that you’re not asking for too much information on a single page.
