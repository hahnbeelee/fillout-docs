## How to change the layout

Click `Theme` to open the **Form designer** in the left-hand panel. Navigate to **Position** and select your preferred one.

<Note>
  Your chosen layout will be automatically applied to the rest of the pages. Currently, only the cover page supports having a different layout to the rest of the form.
</Note>

You can choose from the following layouts (listed from top-left to bottom-right):

- **Clean** - no image, but background color can be changed
- **Right** - fields on the right + image on the left
- **Left** - fields on the left + image on the right
- **Under** - fields under a cover image
- **Through** - fields through image
- **Over** - fields in a container on top of the image

<Note>
  For full page images, generally 16:9 is best or 1280 x 720. For side-by-side layouts, 512 x 720 is the ideal size, however you can use any size because the positioning can be [adjusted](/image-gif).
</Note>

## How to edit animations

Certain positions come with subtle animations or page transitions out of the box. Click `Preview` to see automatic animations based on your chosen position. You can edit this in the [Advanced designer](https://www.fillout.com/help/advanced-designer).
