## Why you should verify submissions

Verifying submissions ensures that the information you receive is accurate and authentic. It helps prevent spam and fraudulent entries, saving time and resources. Additionally, verification builds trust with users by protecting their data and maintaining the integrity of your brand.

## Enable email verification

First, click the email field or question followed by its <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" />. In the right-hand panel, toggle the `Send verification code` switch.

That’s it! A verification code will now be sent to your respondents when they fill out your form.
