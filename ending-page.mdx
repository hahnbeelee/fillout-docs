## How to add an ending page

An **Ending** page is added by default when you create a new form. You can add more ending pages by clicking `+ Add page` followed by **Ending**.

<Tip>
  Use [page logic](/page-logic) to send different users to different ending pages.
</Tip>

## **Ending page types**

In the left-hand panel, there are three types of ending pages you can choose from: **Page**, **New form** and **Redirect**.

### **Page (default)**

The default ending page thanks respondents for submitting a form. Users can customize the thank-you text, add images, banners, and other fields to display upon submission via the left-hand panel or by highlighting text.

### **New form**

This ending type lets users redirect respondents to another form and optionally pass URL parameters, such as carrying over the respondent's name or email to the next form. See [here](/combine-and-repeat-forms) for more information.

/>

### **Redirect**

This redirects users to another link like your homepage or portal after form submission, skipping the default Fillout ending page.

## Let respondents fill out your form again

Respondents can fill out your form multiple times. Simply add a `Fill again` button from the left-hand panel. More details [here](/fill-again-button).

## Let users save their responses

Add a `Send response` or `Download PDF` field. In the former option,  respondents will receive a copy of their form submission in their email inbox.

As for the latter field, respondents will be given the option to have a PDF copy of their submission after completing the form. You must [upload a PDF](https://www.fillout.com/help/pdfs) first to enable this.
