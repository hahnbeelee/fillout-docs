You can toggle `Include a link to edit submission` to allow your respondents to revise their answers later on.

That's it! Respondents will now automatically receive an email notification upon submission containing a summary of their responses like the one below.

<Warning>
  Make sure you have an **Email Address** field in your form so that Fillout knows where to send the respondent email to.
</Warning>

## Tailor messages depending on the response

You can send a different message to a group of respondents depending on the answers they have provided in the form through **Custom emails**.

Choose `Send email only if conditions match`. Check out this quick [guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/custom-emails#send-different-messages-based-on-responses).
