## What is Trello?

[Trello](https://trello.com/?ref=fillout-forms-help-article) is a tool that helps you organize tasks and projects using visual boards and lists. It allows team members to easily collaborate and manage their work.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link your Fillout form to Trello">
    Click `Integrate` on the top menu and look for `Trello`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Reference form fields">
    First, select a **board** and a **list**. Then, reference fields by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> or typing **@**. You can enter text for the **Card title** and **Card description**, if needed.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    Once your form’s all good, click `Finish setup` on the upper right corner followed by `Publish`. Now, you’ll see a new card in your Trello board for every new form submission.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create issues based on conditions

You can choose to create certain types of issues only when a condition is met. For example, create cards for different lists depending on what respondents specify in the form. More details [here](/conditional-integration).
