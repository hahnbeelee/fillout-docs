## Overview

Connecting a Fillout form to Salesforce enables users to automatically sync form responses into a Salesforce object. Existing fields are [mapped automatically](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce#how-it-works), however you can still made edits and updates with manual mapping.

Fillout also lets you **create multiple objects from a single form** using linked records. A **linked record** connects one Salesforce record to another. When you add this to your form, respondents can fill out a child form (a.k.a. subform) to create related records, adding as many as needed.

## How to set up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a custom child object">
    You must first make an object that will hold the responses for your child form before linking it to the main (parent) object.

    Navigate to `Object Manager` to `+ Create New Object`.

    For example, let’s create child forms for different restaurants that customers can fill out, then link them to a parent order form in a single submission.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a lookup field">
    Click `Fields & Relationships` followed by `New`. Choose **Lookup Relationship** in the next window.

    Then, choose the **related object**. In our example, we'll link it to the Order object.

    Make any changes to the default labels or selections in the next steps if necessary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a record picker">
    Once you have finished the steps in Salesforce, go back to your Fillout form. [Connect to Salesforce](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce#how-it-works) if you haven't already.

    On your [Salesforce-connected form](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce#how-it-works), click the `Record picker` field (called Lookup in Salesforce) from your obect in the left-hand panel.

    />

    Alternatively, connect to Airtable first so your `Link to another record` field there automatically appears in Fillout. No manual mapping needed.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable create records option">
    Click the field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to enable `Can create new records?`.

    In the right-hand panel, you can also:

    - **Edit record creation form** - modify the subform used for creating new records
    - **Only show new records** - let respondents create new records, but not select existing records
    - **Pass information to subform** - specify fields or info from your main form to the subform

    <Warning>
      You have to register URL parameters in your subform first. Check out [this short guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/url-parameters#how-to-add-a-url-parameter-or-hidden-field).
