## Overview

Connecting a Fillout form to Salesforce enables users to automatically sync form responses into a Salesforce object. Existing fields are [mapped automatically](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce#how-it-works), however you can still made edits and updates with [manual mapping](https://www.fillout.com/help/additional-integration-mappings#how-to-map-fields-manually).

Fillout also lets you **create records on multiple objects with a single form** using master-detail relationships. A **master-detail relationship** creates a parent–child connection between two Salesforce records. Add this to your form to let respondents fill out a parent form and a subform to create related records, adding as many as needed.

## How to set up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a relationship field">
    On your [Salesforce-connected form](https://www.fillout.com/help/salesforce#how-it-works), add a `Relationship field` from the left-hand panel. These are marked by <Icon icon="file-magnifying-glass" iconType="solid" size={22} />.

      style={{ width:"34%" }}
    />

    <Warning>
      Objects must be linked via a master-detail relationship, not a lookup relationship. Additionally,  required Salesforce fields must be filled out by respondents in order for the results to sync.
    </Warning>
    For example, let's link our Fillout form to the Contact object. For the relationship field, we'll pick Individual ID. When a respondent adds a new record, a small popup form (subform) will open for entering the related information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable record creation">
    Click the field's <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> to enable `Can create new records?`.

    In the right-hand panel, you can also:

    - **Edit record creation form** - modify the subform used for creating new records
    - **Only show new records** - let respondents create new records, but not select existing records
    - **Pass information to subform** - specify fields or info from your main form to the subform

    <Warning>
      You have to register URL parameters in your subform first. Check out [this short guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/url-parameters#how-to-add-a-url-parameter-or-hidden-field).
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and share">
    When everything's set, click `Publish` to make the changes reflect. That's it! Every form submission will now be created as records on both Salesforce objects.
