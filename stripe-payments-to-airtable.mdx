    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure payment settings (Optional)">
    In the left-hand panel, you can switch payment type, add discount codes, add payment methods, and more. Check [this article](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page#customize-payment-settings) to learn more.

    <Tip>
      You can test your live form without getting charged. Create a 100% off coupon in Stripe, then enable the "[Discount Codes](https://www.fillout.com/help/payment-page#add-discount-codes)" option to apply it during checkout. Once testing is done, just toggle the discount codes back off.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the form to an Airtable">
    Click `Integrate` on the top menu to connect to your Airtable account. Then, choose a [base and table](/airtable).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map Airtable columns to form payment fields">
    Go to your Airtable base, and create one column per payment field.

    Then, `+ Add new` Airtable field on the left and select the corresponding Fillout field on the right.

  <Step title="Publish">
    That’s it! Click `Publish` and share the link or embed it on your website. You’ll now get a new row filled out every time someone completes a purchase.
