## Track submissions

After sending your form, you'll be able to `Track responses` in the same pop-up.

Alternatively, you can go back to the `Share` page to do this. Here, you'll see if a recipient has **Not started**, is **In progress**, or has **Completed** your form.

## Automate form sending with Zapier

You can [create a Zap](/zapier) to automate emailing forms. After connecting the necessary apps, select a **Trigger**.

In this example, when a user cancels their subscription in Stripe, we'll send a Fillout form, which would be the **Action**. Click `Publish` when everything’s set.

That's it! Any user who cancels will automatically receive the Fillout form.
