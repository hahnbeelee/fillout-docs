## How to set up skip logic

On your form builder, go to `Logic`. For example, let’s ask respondents which specific services they would like to avail.

By default, each page connects to a single page, until the **Ending page**. We want to create a dynamic form that will only show pages relevant to previous answers.

First, drag and drop the `+` connector of the page containing the question to the connector of the relevant page. Then, `Set condition`.

Say, the respondent selects Solutions and Training only. In this case, we’ll have them skip the page(/s) that come before it, Consultation.

Now, let’s make a path for when they select only one option like Solutions. We’ll add `+ Add branch` to skip the page(/s) after it, Training.

For the remaining options, `+ Add branch` and repeat the same process. Configure the branches as you see fit.
