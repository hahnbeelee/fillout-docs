## How to set up skip logic

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Logic">
    On your form builder, go to `Logic`. For example, let’s ask respondents which specific services they would like to avail.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create branches">
    By default, each page connects to a single page, until the **Ending page**. We want to create a dynamic form that will only show pages relevant to previous answers.

    First, drag and drop the <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> connector of the page containing the question to the connector of the relevant page.

  <Step title="Set conditions">
    Say, the respondent selects "Solutions" and "Training" only. In this case, we’ll have them skip the page(/s) that come before it, "Consultation".

    Now, let’s make a path for when they select only one option like "Solutions". We’ll add a branch to skip the page(/s) after it, "Training".

    For the remaining options, add branches and repeat the same process. Configure the conditions as you see fit.
