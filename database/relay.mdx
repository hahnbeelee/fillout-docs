## Overview

The [Zite Relay.app integration](https://www.relay.app/apps/zite/integrations) lets you connect your Zite databases and tables to other apps. You can automate workflows by triggering actions when data changes in Zite, or push data into Zite from other applications.

<Tip>
  Relay.app offers human-in-the-loop functionality, allowing you to add manual approval or review steps in your automations.
