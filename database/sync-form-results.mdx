<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Zite Database">
    Open your form and click the `Integrate` tab at the top. Select **Zite Database** from the list of integrations.

    <img
      src="/images/linktodb.png"
      alt="linktodb.png"
      title="linktodb.png"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose database option">
    Pick **New database** to create a fresh database for this form, or **Existing database**.

    If you choose an existing database, a new table will be created specifically for this form's responses.

    <img
      src="/images/linktodbsuccess.png"
      alt="linktodbsuccess.png"
      title="linktodbsuccess.png"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your data">
    Your form is now linked to a database! You can view responses in two places:

    - **From your form**: Click the `Results` tab at the top
    - **From the database**: Navigate to your database and click the `Forms` tab to see all linked forms

    <img
      src="/images/zitedbtabs.png"
      alt="zitedbtabs.png"
      title="zitedbtabs.png"
    />

    New responses will sync automatically to your database in real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens next

Once linked, every form submission creates a new record in your database. You can:

- View and edit responses directly in the database
- Add custom fields to store additional data
- Build apps on top of your form data
- Use the REST API to access your responses programmatically

<Note>
Form responses sync instantly to your database. Any changes you make in the database won't affect the original form submission.
