Permanently deletes a webhook subscription. Once deleted, your endpoint will no longer receive notifications for the subscribed events.

<Warning>
This action cannot be undone. If you need to temporarily stop receiving webhooks, consider updating the webhook to set `active: false` instead.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://tables.fillout.com/api/v1/bases/{databaseId}/webhooks/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webhook deleted successfully"
}
```

### Webhook Not Found (404)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Webhook not found"

This error occurs when:
- The webhook ID doesn't exist
- The webhook belongs to a different database
- You don't have access to this database
