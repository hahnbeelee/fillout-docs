title: Webhooks Overview
description: Receive real-time notifications when database events occur
---

Webhooks allow you to receive HTTP POST notifications when events occur in your database. Instead of polling for changes, you can subscribe to specific events and receive instant updates.

## Event Types

Webhooks support the following event types:

### Record Events
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `record.created` | A new record was added to a table |
| `record.updated` | An existing record was modified |
| `record.deleted` | A record was deleted from a table |

### Table Events
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `table.created` | A new table was added to the database |
| `table.updated` | A table's properties (like name) were changed |
| `table.deleted` | A table was deleted |

### Field Events
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `field.created` | A new field was added to a table |
| `field.updated` | A field's properties or configuration were changed |
| `field.deleted` | A field was removed from a table |

## Webhook Payload

When an event occurs, we send an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL with a JSON payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "type": "record.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "tableId": "tbl_abc123",
    "recordIds": ["rec_xyz789"],
    "records": [
      {
        "id": "rec_xyz789",
        "data": {
          "Name": "John Doe",
          "Email": "john@example.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "webhookId": 123,
    "organizationId": 456,
    "baseId": "base_def456",
    "attempt": 1,
    "source": "ui"
  }
}
```

### Payload Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique event ID for idempotency |
| `type` | string | The event type (e.g., `record.created`) |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred |
| `data` | object | Event-specific data (see below) |
| `metadata.webhookId` | number | ID of the webhook subscription |
| `metadata.organizationId` | number | Your organization ID |
| `metadata.baseId` | string | The database ID |
| `metadata.attempt` | number | Delivery attempt number (1 for first attempt) |
| `metadata.source` | string | Where the change originated (`ui`, `public_api`, `zapier`, `make`, `import`) |

### Record Event Data

For record events (`record.created`, `record.updated`, `record.deleted`):

```json
{
  "tableId": "tbl_abc123",
  "recordIds": ["rec_xyz789"],
  "records": [...],
  "previousRecords": [...]  // Only for record.updated
}
```

### Table Event Data

For table events (`table.created`, `table.updated`, `table.deleted`):

```json
{
  "tableId": "tbl_abc123",
  "table": {
    "id": "tbl_abc123",
    "name": "Customers",
    "order": 0,
    "primaryFieldId": "fld_xyz"
  },
  "previousTable": {...}  // Only for table.updated
}
```

### Field Event Data

For field events (`field.created`, `field.updated`, `field.deleted`):

```json
{
  "tableId": "tbl_abc123",
  "fieldId": "fld_xyz789",
  "field": {
    "id": "fld_xyz789",
    "name": "Email",
    "type": "email",
    "order": 1
  },
  "previousField": {...}  // Only for field.updated
}
```

## Verifying Webhook Signatures

Each webhook request includes an `X-Webhook-Signature` header containing an HMAC-SHA256 signature. Verify this signature to ensure the request came from Fillout.

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest('hex');

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}

// In your webhook handler
app.post('/webhooks/fillout', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature(req.body, signature, YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET);

  if (!isValid) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  // Process the webhook...
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Request Headers

Each webhook request includes these headers:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `X-Webhook-Signature` | HMAC-SHA256 signature of the payload |
| `X-Webhook-Event` | The event type (e.g., `record.created`) |
| `X-Webhook-ID` | The unique event ID |
| `User-Agent` | `Fillout-Webhooks/1.0` |

## Retry Policy

If your webhook endpoint returns a non-2xx status code or times out, we'll retry the delivery:

- **Maximum retries**: 5
- **Retry delays**: 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s (exponential backoff)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per request

<Note>
Your endpoint should return a 2xx status code within 30 seconds to acknowledge receipt. Process the webhook asynchronously if needed.
</Note>

## Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max webhooks per database | 100 |
| Max events per webhook | 20 |
| Max URL length | 2,048 characters |
| Max payload size | 256 KB |
| Delivery timeout | 30 seconds |

## Best Practices

1. **Respond quickly**: Return a 2xx status immediately, then process asynchronously
2. **Handle duplicates**: Use the event `id` for idempotency in case of retries
3. **Verify signatures**: Always verify the `X-Webhook-Signature` header
4. **Use HTTPS**: Webhook URLs must use HTTPS for security
5. **Store your secret**: Save the webhook secret securely - it's only shown once on creation
