Claude Code is a tool from Anthropic that accesses Claude through the terminal or an IDE extension.

<Warning>
  Claude only supports MCP connections on their Pro and Max plans.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the Claude command-line tools to add Zite MCP">
    Run the following command with Claude's command-line interface:

    `claude mcp add --transport http zite https://mcp.fillout.com/mcp`

    This should print out something like:

    `Added HTTP MCP server zite with URL: https://mcp.fillout.com/mcp to local config`

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize the connection">
    Within Claude Code, enter `/mcp` to bring up the MCP tools. You should see a view like this:

    ![claude-code-authenticate.png](/images/mcp/claude-code-authenticate.png)

    Use the arrow keys to select the zite connector and press enter, then select "Authenticate".

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize the connection">
    Claude Code will send you over to Zite in your browser with this authorization screen:

    ![claude-code-oauth.png](/images/mcp/claude-code-oauth.png)

    Click the "Authorize" button to complete your connection. You'll now see a success message and can close the browser window.
    Back in Claude, you should see a message like this one:

    ![claude-code-postauth.png](/images/mcp/claude-code-postauth.png)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start chatting">
    You're all set. At this point you can head back to Claude Code's chat interface and start accessing your Zite data.
  </Step>
