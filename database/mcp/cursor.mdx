  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a custom MCP connection">
    Click "Add Custom MCP". This will bring up an editor for a JSON file where you need you need to add an entry to the `mcpServers`
    list like this:

    ```
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Zite": {
          "url": "https://mcp.fillout.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Once you've edited the file, save it and return to the settings panel.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the authentication process">
    Back in the settings panel, you should see an entry for the Zite MCP server like this:

    Click the "Connect" button to start the authentication process. This will pop up a dialog asking if you want to allow Cursor
    to visit and external website. Click "Open" to continue the authentication process in Zite.

  </Step>

    Cursor will send you over to Zite with this authorization screen:
