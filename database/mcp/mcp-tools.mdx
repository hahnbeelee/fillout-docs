With the Zite MCP installed, you're ready to discover how AI assistants can leverage these tools to create, query, and organize data
in your databases.

These tools are designed to work together through natural language prompts, and combining them is where they truly shine. A single
prompt can query your tables, create new records from what it finds, and update fields across multiple entries. Learning how these
tools work helps you write more effective prompts that chain operations together to accomplish complex tasks.
