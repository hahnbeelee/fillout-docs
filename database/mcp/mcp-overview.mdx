Connect your AI tools to Zite using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro),
an open standard that lets AI assistants interact with your Zite datbases.

## What is Zite MCP?

Our MCP service allows you to connect your existing AI tools to your Zite data for both read and write access. This means you can
interact with your data using natural language, both to gain insights from the data you already have and to create new data within Zite.

## What can I do with it?

You can use Zite MCP to ask questions about data you already have, for example:

- "Give me a list of my Zite datbases"
- "Show me information about my Test Scores database in Zite"
- "What is the average score in the Test Scores database"

You can also use it to add new databases and manipulate data, for example:

- "Create a Zite database with countries of the world and their populations"
- "Change the test score for Paul to 96"
- "Scan the document I've uploaded and create a Zite database based on the data you find"

## How to get started

Follow our [connection guide](/database/mcp/connection-overview) to start using Zite MCP.
