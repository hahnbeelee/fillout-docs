    Click the "Authorize" button to complete your connection. This will send you back to Claude's settings page with the connector
    fully set up.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: change default permissions">
    Clicking the "Configure" button next to your connector gives you options for setting the default permission level for Zite MCP.
    By default, Claude must ask permission before executing any of the tools, but you can change the permissions here so it doesn't
    have to ask or to block specific operations.
