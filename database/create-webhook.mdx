title: Create Webhook
description: Creates a new webhook subscription to receive notifications when database events occur.
openapi: "/database/openapi.json POST /bases/{databaseId}/webhooks"
---

Creates a new webhook subscription for the specified database. The webhook will receive HTTP POST notifications when the subscribed events occur.

## Event Types

Subscribe to any combination of these events:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `record.created` | Triggered when new records are added |
| `record.updated` | Triggered when existing records are modified |
| `record.deleted` | Triggered when records are deleted |
| `table.created` | Triggered when new tables are added |
| `table.updated` | Triggered when table properties change |
| `table.deleted` | Triggered when tables are deleted |
| `field.created` | Triggered when new fields are added |
| `field.updated` | Triggered when field properties change |
| `field.deleted` | Triggered when fields are deleted |

## Filtering by Table

Use the optional `tableId` parameter to receive events only for a specific table:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
  "events": ["record.created", "record.updated"],
  "tableId": "tbl_abc123"
}
```

Omit `tableId` to receive events from all tables in the database.

## Example: Subscribe to Record Changes

```bash
curl -X POST "https://tables.fillout.com/api/v1/bases/{databaseId}/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/fillout",
    "events": ["record.created", "record.updated", "record.deleted"]
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "secret": "a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
}
```

<Warning>
Store the `secret` securely - it is only returned once on creation and cannot be retrieved later. You'll need this secret to verify webhook signatures.
</Warning>
