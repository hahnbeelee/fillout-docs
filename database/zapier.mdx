## Overview

The [Zite Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/zite/integrations) lets you connect your Zite databases and tables to thousands of other apps. You can automate workflows by triggering actions when data changes in Zite, or push data into Zite from other applications.

<Tip>
  The integration uses OAuth 2.0—you'll be prompted to log in to your Fillout/Zite account and authorize Zapier to access your databases.
</Tip>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Zite to Zapier">
    Log in to your [Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) or create a new one. Hover over the left-hand panel and click `App Connections` followed by `+ Add connection`. Then, search for **Zite**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Zap">
    Use a pre-made Zap or create your own. Hover over the left-hand panel, and click `+ Create` followed by `Zaps`. Select **Zite** as the trigger or action app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your Database and Table">
    Choose the **Database** and **Table** you want to connect. Zapier will dynamically show all the fields from your selected table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and publish">
    Click `Test` to make sure everything's working, then `Publish` your Zap.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Triggers

Start a Zap when something happens in Zite:

| Trigger | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **New Record** | Fires when a new record is created in a table |
| **Updated Record** | Fires when an existing record is updated |
| **Deleted Record** | Fires when a record is deleted from a table |
| **New Table** | Fires when a new table is created in a database |
| **New Field** | Fires when a new field is added to a table |

<Info>
  All triggers use webhooks for instant, real-time triggering—no polling delays.
</Info>

## Actions

Do something in Zite from another app:

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Create Record** | Creates a new record in a table |
| **Update Record** | Updates an existing record (only provide fields you want to update) |
| **Delete Record** | Deletes a record from a table |
| **Create Table** | Creates a new table in a database |
| **Create Field** | Creates a new field in a table |

## Searches

Find data in Zite to use in your Zaps:

| Search | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Find Record** | Finds a record by exact field value match |
| **Find Table** | Finds a table by name (partial, case-insensitive) |
| **Find Field** | Finds a field by name (partial, case-insensitive) |

<Tip>
  Use "Find Record" as a search step, then conditionally create a new record only if one doesn't exist.
</Tip>
