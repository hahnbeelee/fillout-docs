## How to set up via settings

On your dashboard, open `Scheduling` <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> settings from the left-hand panel to edit your default **Working hours**.

Edit each day’s availability individually, or click **\+** beside a day to split your availability and leave a buffer for a lunch break, for example. You can quickly copy your availability to a different day by clicking <Icon icon="clone" iconType="solid" /> and change your preferred **Timezone**.

<Warning>
  Fillout Scheduling shares availability across all your forms. Any changes made to your available hours will update availability settings on all forms.
</Warning>

## Add multiple availabilities

You can add more availabilities to organize your time better. In your `Scheduling` <Icon icon="gear-complex" iconType="solid" /> settings, click `+ New Availability` to get started.

<Warning>
  You can't set availability for a specific date. To adjust, block the day in your Google or Outlook Calendar, or temporarily update your weekly hours in Fillout and revert them later.
