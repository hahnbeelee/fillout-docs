## Login page types

In the left-hand panel, you can choose between **Email**, **Password**, and **Single Sign-On (SSO)**.

### Email login

This is the default **Verification type**, which requires respondents to enter an email and verify it with a code sent to their inbox.

In the left-hand panel, you can add more restrictions such as:

- **Restrict domains** – allow only specific email domains, such as your company’s domain
- **Limit to 1 submission** – restrict each respondent to a single form submission
- **Connect to a database** – allow only users listed in a specific database to log in, and retrieve their records for use in the form

### **Password login**

Switch to `Password` and enter your preferred single passcode in the left-hand panel. You can edit this later on.

Remember to `Publish` your form after entering or changing the password, otherwise respondents will not be able to access your form.

### Single Sign-On login (SSO)

You can also opt for `SSO`. Add Microsoft, OneLogin, Google Workspaces, Okta and other types of SSO login to your form. Learn more [here](/sso-form-login).

## Allow respondents to edit past submissions

Some forms may need to be updated or edited after submitting them. Under **Basics** in the left-hand panel, toggle the `Can edit existing responses` switch.
