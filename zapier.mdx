## What is Zapier?

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/fillout/integrations) lets you connect an app to 2,000+ other web services. **Zaps** (set up in minutes with no coding) are workflows that automate your day-to-day tasks between apps. Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link Fillout to Zapier">
    First, log in to your [Zapier account](https://zapier.com/sign-up) or create a new account. Then, hover over the left-hand panel and click `App Connections` followed by `+ Add connection`.

    Then, search for **Fillout Forms**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Zap">
    Use a pre-made Zap or create your own. Hover over the left-hand panel, and click `+ Create` followed by `Zaps`.

    />

    \
    Let's select `Fillout Forms` as the **trigger** app. By default, the automation will start after receiving `New submissions`.

    Then, click `Continue` to choose a \*\*Form \*\*from your Fillout account.

    For our next app, we'll choose `Slack` and `Send Channel Message` as the **Action event** from the right side.

    Then, click `Continue` to select a Slack **Channel** and configure other settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Message Text">
    You can send the same fixed message (e.g., New ticket received) for submissions received or send each respondent's answers. To do this, map fields by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> and selecting them in the left dropdown.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your automation">
    Click `Test run` on the upper right corner to make sure everything's working as intended.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish">
    Once everything's set click `Publish` on the upper right corner. Now, all new submissions will be sent to the Slack channel.
  </Step>
