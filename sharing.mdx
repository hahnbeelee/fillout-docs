## Share your form link

Click the `Publish` button at the top right of your form editor. Make sure your form is ready to go by trying it in `Preview` mode first!

Then, `Copy` the unique link to your form, or open it in a new tab <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" />.

You can also view your link at any time in the `Share` tab from the top menu.

## Embed Fillout forms

Pick an embed option in the `Share` tab. You can embed it on your website in four different ways:

- **Standard** - a block embed on your site, which can be controlled in height and width
- **Popup** - an embed in a large popup on screen, opens the form by pressing a button
- **Full screen** - an embed that takes up the entire screen
- **Slider** - in a sliding bar from either the left or the right side of the screen, opens the form by pressing a button

Click `Use this embed` and copy/paste the result into your website builder, or directly into your HTML code. That’s all! Your forms should be ready to go.
