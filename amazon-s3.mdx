## What is Amazon S3?

<Info>
  The Amazon S3 integration is available on the **Team** and **Enterprise** plans. Learn more about the [Team plan](/team-plan).

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable cloud storage solution provided by AWS, designed to store and retrieve any amount of data with high availability and security. Ideal for businesses and developers, S3 offers cost-effective, reliable data storage for applications, backups, and content distribution, making it a top choice for cloud storage needs.

## How it works
