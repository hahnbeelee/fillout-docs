## Edit form link

In the `Share` page of your form, you can easily customize your link ending or slug. More info [here](/custom-link).

Paid Fillout accounts can also [add a custom domain](/custom-domains) for fully branded scheduling forms.

## Change your avatar

Simply hover over the avatar in your form to `Customize` it. Alternatively, you may do so in the [booking page](/how-to-create-scheduling-form#1590ee47667b80718a29f72c05c84a8d) from the left-hand panel.
