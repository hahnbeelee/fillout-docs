## What is Make?

[**Make**](https://www.make.com/) (formerly Integromat) is a robust platform that lets you create and automate a wide range of tasks and processes called **Scenarios**, spanning from individual tasks and workflows to integrating various apps and systems seamlessly.

**Scenarios** start with a **Trigger**, an event that starts the automation, and which causes a series of predefined **Actions** to occur in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a scenario">
    Log in to your [Make account](https://www.make.com/register) or create a new account. Then, `+ Create a new scenario`.

    Click <Icon icon="circle-plus" iconType="solid" /> to select a trigger and search for **Fillout** to `Watch new responses`.

    />

    Click **\+** beside the Fillout form bubble to select an **app** and **action**.
