## What is Squarespace?

[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) is a popular website builder for online portfolios, blogs, and eCommerce shops.  The platform includes some built-in form functionality, especially for newsletter signup and product checkout forms, but design options are limited and there are no advanced logic or multi-page options.

## Add a full screen embed

If you’re adding a **Full screen** Fillout embed to a Squarespace site, you may need to use code injection to prevent the sitewide header and footer from rendering on top of your form.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a blank page">
    From your site’s Home Menu, open the **Website** tab. Click + next to either **Main Navigation** or **Not Linked** and choose `Blank Page`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove header and footer">
    After giving the page a name, click <Icon icon="gear-complex" /> next to it and open the **Advanced** tab. Paste `<style>.header, #footer-sections {display:none!important;}</style>` into the **Page Header Code Injection** textbox and click `Save`.

    Now that the header and footer are removed, add a **blank section** to the page, then add an `Embed` block with your **Full screen embed code,** anywhere on the page.
  </Step>
</Steps>
