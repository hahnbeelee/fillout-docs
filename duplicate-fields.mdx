## Connect duplicated questions to an integration

If you’re using an integration like [Airtable](/airtable) or [Notion](/notion), you’ll notice that your new question is **Not connected** to a field yet.

Select a question followed by <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to choose a `field` you'd like to connect it to from the dropdown.
