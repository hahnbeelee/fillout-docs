    **Workflow triggers**

    A trigger refers to a condition that starts a specific action or series of actions. Examples are:

      <Card title="Form submitted" icon="square-check" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal="true">
        
      </Card>

      </Card>
      <Card title="Scheduling event canceled" icon="calendar-xmark" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>
        
      </Card>
      <Card title="Event rescheduled" icon="calendar-pen" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>

      <Card title="Before event starts" icon="calendar-circle-exclamation" iconType="regular" color="#FFC738" horizontal>
        
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an action">
    Select an **action** and `Edit` it according to your preferences. To add more actions, click <Icon icon="circle-plus" />.

## 1-click automations with templates

The fastest way to get started with workflows is from a [template](https://build.fillout.com/home/workflows). These are common use cases for Fillout Workflows.
