## Notice

Please note that deleting your Fillout account **cannot be undone**. Account deletion will remove your entire [organization](/organizations), which includes [workspaces](/workspaces), forms, respondent submissions, collaborators' forms and unsubscribe you from email notifications.

<Info>
  Only the **account owner** can delete their own account and they have to downgrade first if they're on a paid plan.

## How to delete your account

Click your `Account name `on the upper left corner followed by `Settings`.

<Warning>
  If you need to just change the email you use, head over to [account settings](https://www.fillout.com/help/account#change-account-email).
</Warning>

Scroll down to `Leave organization`. This will automatically delete your account.
