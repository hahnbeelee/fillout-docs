## How to send a collaborative form

Open your form and go to the `Share` tab from the top menu. Click `Send form`.

Next, `Set recipients` and enter the emails of your chosen respondents. Here, you can edit the subject, enable reminders, and choose your preferred frequency. Then, click `Send form`.

The recipients will receive an authenticated link to the form via email. Any changes made by any of the recipients will be **automatically synced across all the respondents**.

<Warning>
  Changes to the form are only synced to integrations (like Airtable, Notion, and SmartSuite) when the form is re-submitted. Partial submissions are viewable on the Results page of your form.
</Warning>

## Tracking results

Go back to the `Share page` and click `Track responses` (beside the Share form button). View in-progress or completed submissions, along with respondent details. For partial submissions, you can also see current responses or the authenticated form link.
