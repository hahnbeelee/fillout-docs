## How to add a hyperlink

Simply highlight any text in your form and click <Icon icon="link" />.

<img

  alt="Screenshot 2025-10-10 at 5.33.31 PM.png"

  style={{ width:"55%" }}
/>

## Add **URL buttons**

You can add a button to an ending page. Drag and drop the `URL button` from the left-hand panel to the form. Then, click its <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to add a URL in the right-hand panel.

You can even make the URL dynamic based on form inputs by clicking <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" />.

## **Automatic redirects**

You can also link to an external page automatically, via a redirect. See [ending page](/ending-page) for details.
