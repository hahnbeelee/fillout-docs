## How to add a hyperlink

Simply highlight any text in your form and click <Icon icon="link" />.

<img

  alt="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 2.02.31 PM.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 2.02.31 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"55%" }}
/>

Insert your URL in the popup and click `Save`.

## Add **URL buttons**

You can add a button to an ending page. Drag and drop the `URL button` from the left-hand panel to the form. Then, click its <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> to add a URL in the right-hand panel.

## Insert dynamic links

You can make your URLs dynamic. In the URL input field, simply type **@** or click <Icon icon="square-plus" iconType="solid" /> to reference form inputs. Then, click `Save`.

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2026-01-12at3.49.12PM.png"
  alt="Screenshot 2026 01 12 At 3 49 12 PM"
  title="Screenshot 2026 01 12 At 3 49 12 PM"
  style={{ width:"55%" }}
/>

In this example, we’ve referenced an applicant’s username in the referral link. Each time a respondent completes this form, a unique link containing their username will be generated.

## **Automatic redirects**

You can also link to an external page automatically, via a redirect. See [ending page](/ending-page) for details.
