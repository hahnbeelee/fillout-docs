## Auto-redirect to another form

Go to your form's [**Ending page**](/ending-page) and click `New form` in the left-hand panel. Then, select the new form you want to redirect respondents to in the dropdown.

### Pass data between forms with URL parameters

Optionally `Set URL parameters` to pre-fill data in the new form. For example, a respondent’s email from the current form can automatically appear in the new form so they don’t have to type them again.

  style={{ width:"71%" }}
/>

First, make sure you've registered the URL parameter in new form to redirect to. Check out to the steps [here](/url-parameters). Then, click `+ Add new` in the popup to set a URL parameter.

That's it! Make sure to `Publish` both forms when you're ready to go live.

## Allowe re-submission

On your form's [**Ending page**](/ending-page) , drag and drop a `Fill again` button from the left-hand panel.

By default, the form will restart from the first page. To change this, enable the `Start from page` switch in the right-hand panel.
