## What is answer piping?

**Answer piping** inserts a respondent's previous form inputs into later questions or text fields for a more personalized and interactive experience. Fillout lets you reference:

- <Icon icon="file-lines" iconType="solid" /> - [previous answers](/answer-piping)
- <Icon icon="link" iconType="solid" /> - [URL parameters](/url-parameters)
- <Icon icon="calculator" iconType="solid" /> - [calculations](https://www.fillout.com/help/calculations#pre-fill-fields-with-a-calculation)
- <Icon icon="calendar" iconType="solid" /> - [custom dates](/pre-fill-dates) (e.g., today, a month from now, etc.)
- <Icon icon="user" iconType="solid" /> - [enriched emails](https://www.fillout.com/help/lead-enrichment#how-to-enrich-emails) with company information

## Reference in field labels

To reference previous form inputs in headings, paragraphs, and banners, type **@**. Then, select the field or question, or simply search for it.

## Reference in answer fields

Reference inputs in answer text fields and choice fields by [pre-filling](https://www.fillout.com/help/prefill-fields).

Fillout also let's you show or a hide a question or field based on previous form inputs via Logic in the right-hand panel. Check out this [quick guide](https://www.fillout.com/help/conditional-hiding#hide-a-question-based-on-a-condition).
