## Overview

Customizing your form’s **link preview text** and **image** is an important way to optimize the shareability of your form. When you share your form on other sites or social media platforms, the **Meta information** such as the title, description, and thumbnail play a crucial role in attracting users to click on your link.

  style={{ width:"60%" }}
/>

## How to edit share preview

By default, your form's share preview shows the name of your form and a general description. To change this, click `Share` on top.

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-12-01at7.07.19PM.png"
  alt="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 7.07.19 PM.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-12-01 at 7.07.19 PM.png"
  style={{ width:"47%" }}
/>

On the lower right area, edit the details as you see fit and `Upload image` to change the default **Thumbnail**.

`Copy` your form link and paste it anywhere you'd like, such as a messaging app or website. Here's how our example looks like when sent in iMessage.

<img
  src="/images/sharing-and-embedding/image-49.png"
  alt=""
  style={{ width:"47%" }}
/>

Remember to `Publish` your form to make the latest changes reflect.

<Note>
  Preview images are cached by platforms, so it may take time for the updated thumbnail to show. Test your preview [here](https://www.opengraph.xyz).
